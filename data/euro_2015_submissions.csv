Eurovision 2015 was amazing.,1f6ftz7,40,"Eurovision 2015 was held in Vienna, Austria after Conchita Wurst's victory the year prior. In my opinion, this was one of the best editions of ESC thus far with several amazing factors. 

Regarding the negatives, there were some mediocre entries (Chain Of Lights - San Marino), (Still In Love With You - United Kingdom), etc.. There was also a plagiarism scandal between Sweden and Azerbaijan about the album covers but it was relatively tame. 

Drama, absolutely, but the positives far outweigh the negatives. 

2015 had an incredible song roster with various entries having genuine shots at winning the contest. These are, but not limited to: 

- Heroes (Mans Zelmerlow - Sweden)

- A Million Voices (Polina Gagarina - Russia)

- Grande Amore (Il Volo - Italy)

- Rhythm Inside (Loic Nottet - Belgium)

- Tonight Again (Guy Sebastian - Australia)

- Love Injected (Aminata - Latvia)

- Goodbye To Yesterday (Stig Rasta & Elina Born - Estonia). AKA: my winner :D

Even some NQs were quite solid in Molly Sterling's (Ireland) Playing With Numbers and Uzari and Maimuna's (Belarus) Time.

This edition also included some noble causes as portrayed in Finland's entry: Aina Mun Pitaa, where each band member had disabilities and/or disorders.

2015 is unique with its number of finalists (27, to be exact), due to the participation of Australia causing some convolution. However, this figure makes it distinct. It proves that Eurovision can connect with other countries despite the drama and I believe that's nice and beneficial.

Though many people shame ESC 2015 due to its number of ballads, it doesn't affect my perspective on it. Sweden stormed the juries, contributing massively towards Mans's victory, but that felt more justified since Heroes was an anthem, a chant for the world, a song for us to persevere, and not some generic pop entry about love. We all have differing opinions, some like emotional love songs, and some like rock and metal. Even then, acknowledging the beauty of a song contest is a beautiful aspect of our views.

As...

We are the heroes of our time, and we're dancing with the demons in our minds.

Why is Sweden and Melfest so hated within the Eurovision Bubble? ,1ezgj63,221,"Since 2019 I have come across a lot of negative reactions and comments when it comes to Sweden at Eurovision. Why is that? If it wasn’t Israel this year, it would probably be Sweden who people would go at because of all accusations about rigging and ABBA 2024 anniversary. In addition to that I have noticed a lot of negative comments about Meflest on here. Let’s take 2024 as an example. When leaks were dropped on here, most were either negative comments or disslikes. Only a few were postive about Sweden’s entries in the comment section. Not forgetting to mention ESC_Gabe who made a whole video after Meflest 2024 on his channel mostly critizing all entries and the year before on ESC_United. I get you don’t always like some songs and every year. But it’s almost every year there are new complaints about Meflest while I see almost no comments about other selections and other countries doing well with very different, but not always good. It’s surley can’t be a concidence after a such long time.  If we look at 2015, 2018,2019 and 2023 which are probably worst ones since this first began too.

[UK] Can anyone submit entries for Eurovision?,1ep8ikf,9,"Hello everyone, I've been wanting to go on Eurovision for a while, and since next year I'll be at the age where I should be able to apply (as on the Eurovision website it says that participants must be 16 on the day of the contest,) I've been looking into applying. However all I've seen online is some old application pages from the BBC from 2015. 

Do the BBC just pick the artists without any submissions happening? Or does anyone know how applying works?",1723338724.0,2024-08-11T11:12:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1ep8ikf/uk_can_anyone_submit_entries_for_eurovision/
Entries having an adjustable section,1ejf2r6,14,"I wonder if a Eurovision entry could take a leaf out of Sabrina Carpenter’s book.

To put it simply, in her 2022 song Nonsense, whenever she performs it live, she adds 3 extra lines to the song’s ending, often honouring where she performs it (including phrases in the languages of the countries she performs in in some cases) and often with some (very) explicit jokes. Is there any ESC entry that can do this or would it not be legitimate?

In ESC, some can apply to add own language parts, or parts in the host language, like Croatia and Montenegro respectively, both in 2022. However only Turkey 2006 changed lyrics between rounds, and Romania 2015 and Latvia 2024 failed promises to do so. Some songs can have minor sound or staging changes and sometimes change outfits between rounds too.

I also discuss songs with hyping sections that can change between rounds, though Austria 2022 was an NQ so it wasn’t known if That would have changed if it qualified.",1722722215.0,2024-08-04T07:56:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1ejf2r6/entries_having_an_adjustable_section/
Results of the subreddit demographic survey 2024,1eiamk0,49,"Hello everyone! First of all, seeing how the survey was closed back in April ([post in question](https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1bnbxsv/subreddit_demographics_survey_2024/)), I apologize for taking *so long* to finally publish these results; real life and a rather chaotic Eurovision season pushed evaluating this data to the back burner. But, the results are finally here!

In total, we have received **1175 responses**. Thank you to everybody for participating! Commentary will be in the description of the images, so you may need to switch to a newer version of Reddit to see it.

For those curious, you can access the spreadsheet with all the data [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ogwV4JIRUOlZ-RQdjPvb92QEXoExjmjVpAd5Z6Drtu4/edit?usp=sharing). Thank you to u/Ylirio for helping out!

# Subreddit Demographics

[During the season, 75.7&#37; of the respondents visited the subreddit daily.](https://preview.redd.it/8myzb8x5avfd1.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc4e8b5130e4fefa46724c2979bdd6f3c5141da3)

[During the off-season, the activity unsurprisingly drops, with the plurality \(26.6&#37;\) preferring to visit a few times a month.](https://preview.redd.it/j59lz7x5avfd1.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcbc312f78cc66189469f1ae5eb797334cfd7b94)

[The vast majority of the subreddit is either 17-24 \(40.3&#37;\) or 25-34 \(37.8&#37;\), mirroring standard Reddit age demographics.](https://preview.redd.it/c08cdfc7evfd1.png?width=733&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d86d1b34fe9ceba8b088632ae8f553fc048c09e)

[52.8&#37; and thus the majority of the subreddit identifies as male, while 38.9&#37; identify as female and 5.7&#37; as non-binary. ](https://preview.redd.it/u0iri0b1cvfd1.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=672e61bce6e8450036f0d51c27077bbff903a666)

[The stereotype of the Eurovision audience rings true, with 61.4&#37; of the respondents not identifying as straight, though heterosexuality still remained as the plurality.](https://preview.redd.it/4se0y92ycvfd1.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4798c2281866976b4d9aa6f8e1b9ec602064f33)

[Unsurprisingly, the majority \(68.9&#37;\) of the respondents are from Europe, with North America being in second place with a share of 19.9&#37;.](https://preview.redd.it/y5vau86uevfd1.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac80d6a3ff62ad297d3279bad5b0adf1edd05fea)

[69.6&#37; of the respondents' countries do currently participate in Eurovision, while 25.9&#37; are from a country with no connection to the contest. 4.5&#37; are from countries that used to participate in the past. ](https://preview.redd.it/unyd3m9wgvfd1.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=188352297394cd30aaad4474224f1a9615470c1f)

[We counted members from 72 different countries on this subreddit. The USA, despite not participating in the contest, is the most represented country on the subreddit, with a whole 17.3&#37; of the respondents being from there. The UK was in second place with a share of 12.8&#37;, then the Netherlands with 6.8&#37; and Germany with 6&#37;. Out of the participants of Eurovision 2024, there were no members only from Albania, Cyprus and \(unsurprisingly\) San Marino. Everybody who named more than one country was counted multiple times. The full list may be accessed in the spreadsheet.](https://preview.redd.it/fplxq1bffvfd1.png?width=6460&format=png&auto=webp&s=d25b2f2529d4c2202c9c82ff2d5585c2669266c4)

[If we map the amount of members per 1 million of the country's population, Iceland has the largest share, with the 4 members of the subreddit resulting in a pretty high count of 10 members per 1 million. Croatia was in second place with 8.25, no doubt influenced by Baby Lasagna's popularity, with Estonia, Finland and Ireland then rounding out the top 5. ](https://preview.redd.it/cayc3xr5hvfd1.png?width=6460&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cd12ccc1dc4bbaeabd02b0456cbfb269996b7d3)

# Eurovision

[We can see that people started watching Eurovision at wildly different times, with the plurality \(30.1&#37;\) having started watching the contest in the noughties. Every other timeframe in this century had a share of around 20&#37; as well, while 8&#37; of the subreddit are true veterans who started watching the contest prior to the turn of the century.](https://preview.redd.it/ns5ahrdkjvfd1.png?width=733&format=png&auto=webp&s=77cf55ae13f3e8ec6841a551d1964430c6def592)

[99.7&#37; of the subreddit watches the Grand Final \(and I do wonder about the 3 people who said they didn't, but I digress\), with 95.7&#37; also watching the semi finals. Just under half the respondents, 47&#37;, also watch the rehearsals. 22.9&#37; watch JESC, while 8.2&#37; also watch other Eurovision spin-offs.](https://preview.redd.it/85a7kjxznvfd1.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&s=18b240a7f64865de5daf00bddf5d761312f231d0)

[It turns out that the subreddit doesn't actually overwhelmingly vote in the contest, with 35.7&#37; and even 50.8&#37; of the respondents only rarely or never voting in the final and semi final respectively. On the other end, 18.9&#37; and 13.8&#37; choose to use all their available votes for the final and semi final respectively. ](https://preview.redd.it/h6df1y41ovfd1.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3b7fc86891875b4a65e7b0673c68259b11defe2)

**Favorite Eurovision song ever?**

As this is more difficult to visualize, I will write this out in text form. Every response that mentioned multiple songs had those songs counted separately.

* **295 different songs** were mentioned, which is 16.8% of the songs that have ever participated in Eurovision.
* The distribution was as follows:
   * 2021-2024: 69 different songs, mentioned 454 times
   * 2016-2020: 62 different songs, mentioned 248 times
   * 2011-2015: 47 different songs, mentioned 159 times
   * 2001-2010: 48 different songs, mentioned 161 times
   * 1991-2000: 35 different songs, mentioned 63 times
   * Pre-1990: 34 different songs, mentioned 58 times

The top 10 most mentioned songs are the following:

1. Käärijä - ""Cha Cha Cha"" (Finland 2023) with 87 mentions
2. Go\_A - ""Shum"" (Ukraine 2021) with 68 mentions
3. Måneskin - ""Zitti e Buoni"" (Italy 2021) with 42 mentions
4. Loreen - ""Euphoria"" (Sweden 2012) with 38 mentions
5. Alexander Rybak - ""Fairytale"" (Norway 2009) with 36 mentions
6. Verka Serduchka - ""Dancing Lasha Tumbai"" (Ukraine 2007) with 26 mentions
7. Hatari -  ""Hatrið mun sigra"" (Iceland 2019) with 25 mentions
8. Cornelia Jakobs - ""Hold Me Closer"" (Sweden 2022) with 20 mentions
9. Konstrakta - ""In Corpore Sano"" (Serbia 2022) with 19 mentions
10. Gjon's Tears - ""Tout l'univers"" (Switzerland 2021) with 19 mentions

[Apologies for only writing out the years, this was truncated for visual clarity's sake. Italy's win in 2021 is the subreddit's decisive favorite winner of the last 10 years, with 35.7&#37; having chosen them. Netherlands in 2019, Austria in 2014 and Ukraine in 2016 then each have just over 9&#37; of the votes, followed by Portugal 2017 \(8.6&#37;\), Ukraine 2022 \(8&#37;\), Sweden 2023 \(7.9&#37;\). The rest have been chosen by 5&#37; of the respondents or less. Note that this survey was done before the 2024 contest, which is why Switzerland's win this year is not included.](https://preview.redd.it/2v7pi73fxvfd1.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=486ed3837eb3f35d6c4c985cdd6e51912af3b87f)

[2021 wins again in terms of being a favorite, with 37.7&#37; of the respondents regarding the show in Rotterdam as their favorite. Liverpool 2023 holds a respectable second place with 25.9&#37; of the votes, while Stockholm 2016 had 12.9&#37; of the votes. Malmö 2024 was again not included in this line-up.](https://preview.redd.it/fgatoqgyyvfd1.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=086959c500876d4f22873b363f26d5d0c75eb8ac)

[With 85.2&#37; of the respondents being either happy or very happy with the song choices, it's clear that the subreddit views the songs themselves quite favorably. The respondents are still broadly satisfied with the show procedure itself, with the majority being happy about it and around a quarter feeling neutral. The voting system is the most scrutinized, with 41.1&#37; being happy or very happy with it, 38.2&#37; feeling neutral about it and 20.7&#37; being unhappy or very unhappy with it.](https://preview.redd.it/29nerq5r0wfd1.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e3452b0352b34093d494742216b77deec3d4568)

[Looking specifically at how the subreddit views the songs of 2024, a higher percentage of people is very happy with the song selection compared to usual \(35.6&#37; for 2024 vs 31.8&#37;\), but the amount of people who are just happy with it is lower \(46.4&#37; for 2024 vs 53.4&#37;\), resulting in an overall lower share of people who are happy\/very happy with it. While the large majority still views the song selection very positively, it does indicate that the year is somewhat more divisive than usually.](https://preview.redd.it/x7l92oea2wfd1.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=352278b0eb5bc9bdee6c5b4b67b38b31b69a27c7)

[For the sake of clarity, only the entries that received more than 5&#37; of the vote are depicted. The subreddit favorite was Croatia's Baby Lasagna, with 20.9&#37; rooting for him to win, while the eventual winner Nemo from Switzerland was the 2nd biggest favorite with 14.6&#37; of the votes. Norway, Netherlands and Italy round out the top 5 with 12.5&#37;, 11&#37; and 7.9&#37; respectively. The full list may be accessed in the spreadsheet.](https://preview.redd.it/7ljgjuhi4wfd1.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bb18fd400495c43810276cc6bef0aee2d31b8e8)

# National Finals

[The plurality \(47.6&#37;\) of the subreddit follows at least a few select national finals, while 21.9&#37; do try to follow as many as possible. 11.9&#37; only follow their own country's national final, while 18.6&#37; do not follow any national finals at all. ](https://preview.redd.it/15dbv2iq7wfd1.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=64172e78c84d121c1bf488503aecd1ea74a75f01)

[For the people who did watch national finals this year, the Nordics were clearly seen as must watches, seeing how the majority watched Norway's MGP \(56.8&#37;\), Sweden's Melodifestivalen \(51.8&#37;\) and Finland's UMK \(51.3&#37;\). Croatia's Dora and Italy's Sanremo then fill out the rest of the top 5 with 45.2&#37; and 42.6&#37; respectively. Latvia's Supernova was unfortunately the national final the fewest amount of people watched, with only 11.9&#37; having tuned in this year.](https://preview.redd.it/wpv31alh9wfd1.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=f85d0b6fd412c5629e2802bffcd3afd4cd8580cf)

[When it comes to which national finals the respondents counted as their favorites, the first place is held by Finland's UMK at 44.7&#37;, with Norway's MGP closely following at 43.2&#37; and Italy's Sanremo taking the third spot at 38.9&#37;. ](https://preview.redd.it/u302cfeuawfd1.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=7df10454641300364bfeda91ec760afb2c747680)

How Many Countries Have WON Eurovision?,1e2fnwj,26,"So over 68 editions of the ESC, we've had 52 countries take part at least once. But how many have won?

The first country to win the Eurovision Song Contest is Switzerland. Their victory was in the inaugural edition of the ESC back in 1956, beating 6 other countries to claim the top spot. They won with the song ‘Refrain’, performed by Lys Assia. They would win again 32 years later in 1988, by just one point, with the song ‘Ne partez pas sans moi’ performed by the one and only Celine Dion. Their third and most recent victory came this year in 2024, as Nemo broke the Code, and the trophy, as they reached the top of the scoreboard.

The second country to win Eurovision is the Netherlands. They won in the second edition of the contest in 1957, beating 9 other countries with the song ‘Net als toen’ performed by Corry Brokken. Their second victory would come shortly afterwards, in the 1959 contest. There they won with the song ‘Een beetje’, performed by Teddy Scholten. A decade later, they would win for a third time, alongside three other competing countries. The 1969 contest was… a strange one, to say the least, and we’ll explore its complications a little bit later. The winning Dutch entrant was Lenny Kuhr, with her song, ‘De troubadour’. In 1975, the Netherlands would win for a fourth time, with the now classic Eurovision tune, ‘Ding-a-dong’, performed by Teach-In, definitely a marmite winner at the time. After more than 40 years without a win, Duncan Laurence would secure the Netherlands fifth and latest victory, with the iconic smash, ‘Arcade’, which is one of the most streamed Eurovision songs ever.  

The third country to win Eurovision is France. They won at the third edition of the ESC in 1958, beating 9 other countries with the song ‘Dors mon amour’, performed by André Claveau. Like the Netherlands, France’s second win would come thick and fast, with them top dogs of the 1960 contest, with the song ‘Tom Pillibi’ performed by Jacqueline Boyer. France would be the first nation to win Eurovision for a third time, triumphing at the 1962 contest, with the song, ‘Un premier amour’ by Isabelle Aubret landing at the top of the scoreboard. Like the Netherlands, France would be one of four winners at the 1969 edition of Eurovision, with Frida Boccara sharing the glory, with her song ‘Un jour, un enfant’. France’s fifth and latest victory occurred all the way back in 1977, when Marie Myriam beat all other competitors to the trophy with her timeless track, ‘L’Oiseau et I’Enfant’.

The fourth country to win Eurovision is Luxembourg. They would win for the first time in 1961, with the song ‘Nous les amoureux’ performed by Jean-Claude Pascal. A couple of years later, France Gall would provide a very contemporary track for Luxembourg’s second win, that being ‘Poupée de cire, poupée de son’, which sounds just about as 1965 as it comes. Luxembourg’s third victory would come in 1972, shining over with the song ‘Après toi’ performed by Vicky Leandros, one of my all-time favourites. Luxembourg would become the first country to score two consecutive wins under its belt, without having to share the victory either. For 1973’s winner would be Anne-Marie David, with the song ‘Tu te reconnaîtras’ notching a fourth star for Luxembourg’s winners table. 10 years later, in 1983, Luxembourg would secure its fifth and latest victory, triumphing over all other entrants with ‘Si la vie est cadeau’, performed by Corinne Hermés.

The fifth country to win Eurovision is Denmark. Their first victory came quite controversially in 1963, with the song Dansevise, performed by Grethe and Jørgen Ingmann beating out 15 other countries, including front-runners, Switzerland. We’ve got a whole little documentary on that particular ESC, which you can check out if you love a good story. It would be nearly 40 years before Denmark would secure another victory. It finally came in 2000, as the Olsen Brothers defied the odds, to win with ‘Fly on the Wings of Love’. 50 years after their first win, in 2013, Denmark would win for a third time. Emmelie de Forest claimed the crown with her song ‘Only Teardrops’ which has since gone on to become a Eurovision anthem.

The sixth country to win Eurovision is Italy. They would win for the first time in 1964, with the beautiful song ‘Non ho l’eta’, performed by Gigliola Cinquetti. A second victory would come in 1990, with Toto Cutugno claiming a surprising win with the unifying track, ‘Insieme: 1992’. After taking an extended break away from the ESC, Italy would eventually return in 2011, regularly placing within the Top 10. Their efforts finally paid off in 2021, with rock band Måneskin taking the trophy with ‘Zitti e buoni’, showing rock is still alive and well at the Contest.

The seventh country to win Eurovision is Austria. They would win at the 1966 edition of the Contest, with the song ‘Merci, Chérie’, performed by Udo Jürgens. It wouldn’t be for nearly another half century before the Austrians could claim another win at Eurovision. Finally, in 2014, that curse was broken by the iconic Conchita Wurst, with their powerful, bold and emotional anthem, ‘Rise Like a Phoenix’. Need we say more?

The eighth country to win Eurovision is the United Kingdom. Despite having one of the most successful music industries on Earth, it wouldn’t be until 1967 for the Brits to triumph at the ESC. They won with ‘Puppet on a String’ performed by 60s legend, Sandie Shaw. Two years later, the UK would win again, alongside three others in the 1969 contest. Don’t worry, I haven’t forgotten about the madness of this one, we’ll get to it. The Brits quarter of the victory came from Lulu and her bouncy track, ‘Boom Bang-a-bang’. The UK would score its third win in 1976, when ‘Save Your Kisses for Me’ by Brotherhood of Man, would not only win, but become the most successful Eurovision single of all time. The 80s started strongly with a 4^(th) British victory, with Bucks Fizz provided a provocative performance with ‘Making Your Mind Up’. Our fifth and latest win came in 1997, when Katrina and the Waves belted out ‘Love Shine a Light’, a song that would hold particular resonance in the decades that followed.

The ninth country to win Eurovision is Spain, who claimed their first win in 1968. Controversially pipping Cliff Richard to the post by one point, as Massiel sang, many times, ‘La La La’. Technically, Spain would be the first country to win two consecutive years in a row, however, their second win would be shared out. As you’ve probably remembered, the 1969 Eurovision was won by 4 countries, namely Spain, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Spain’s share of that victory came from Salomé, who performed the song, ‘Vivo cantando’. So how did this happen? In a nutshell, all four winning countries received the same amount of points. And what was the tie-break solution? Well, there wasn’t one. The thought of a tie-break simply hadn’t occurred to the organisers back in 1969, so in a mad rush, all four entrants were declared the winner. Such an event would never happen again in Eurovision history.

The tenth country to win Eurovision is Ireland, who would win over 11 other countries in 1970 to take their first of many victories. ‘All Kinds of Everything’ was the first song to do the trick, sung by a young girl, named Dana. 10 years later, at the 1980 Contest, Johnny Logan would woo audiences all over the world, with the beautiful ballad, ‘What’s Another Year?’. Seven years later, in 1987, Logan would return once again to represent Ireland and made ESC history, by being the first artist to win the Contest twice, with the song ‘Hold Me Now’, giving Ireland their third victory. The 1990s would prove to be an unprecedented decade for Ireland at Eurovision. 1992 would be the first year, with Linda Martin giving Ireland its fourth win with the song, ‘Why Me?’. They’d win for a second consecutive year in 1993, with Niamh Kavanagh representing with the song ‘In Your Eyes’, securing a fifth win for the Emerald Isle. The following year, in 1994, Ireland would break several ESC records. Not only did they win for a sixth time, the first country to do so, but they were the first to win the Eurovision for three years in a row. The song to do it would be ‘Rock ‘n’ Roll Kids’, performed by Paul Harrington and Charlie McGettigan. After taking a year of winning in 1995, the Irish would return in force for 1996, Eimear Quinn bagging them their seventh and most recent win, with the haunting track, ‘The Voice’. For over 25 years, Ireland held the title of most Eurovision wins. One other county has since joined their ranks, and we’ll touch on them a little later.

The eleventh country to win Eurovision is Monaco. One of the smallest nations to take part, they were a regular fixture at the Contest for many of its early years. Monaco’s one and only victory would arrive in 1971, with Séverine delivering the song, ‘Un banc, un arbre, une rue’. Monaco would briefly return in the 2000’s, but after 2006, they have yet to make an appearance in Eurovision again.

The twelfth country to win Eurovision is Sweden. Their first win would be one of the most famous ever in ESC history, when ABBA lit up the stage, with Waterloo. It would be 10 years later when a second win would befall the Swedes, with Herreys wearing their golden shoes, singing ‘Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley’. In 1991, Carola would give them their third win with ‘Fångad av en stormvind’, one of my favourites, though it had the same points as France’s entry, only winning as it received more 12 points. In 1999, Sweden won for a fourth time with ‘Take Me To Your Heaven’, performed by Charlotte Nilsson. 2012 would be a monumental one for Sweden, with Loreen absolutely dominating the scoreboard with anthemic, ‘Euphoria’. Just a few years later in 2015, Måns Zelmerlöw claimed a sixth victory for Sweden, with the song ‘Heroes’. In 2023, Loreen pulled a Johnny Logan, and won the ESC for a second time, giving Sweden their seventh win, equalising Ireland’s record, one it now shares. The song to take the Swedes there, was ‘Tattoo’.

The thirteenth country to win Eurovision is Israel. Their first win would come in 1978, with Izhar Cohen and the Alpha-Beta singing A-Ba-Ni-Bi. The following year in 1979, Israel would win the ESC for a second consecutive year, providing one of the most remembered winning songs, ‘Hallelujah’ performed by Milk & Honey. A third victory wouldn’t arrive until 1998, with Dana International and their song Diva pushing boundaries, as the first transgender winner of the Eurovision Song Contest. 20 years later, in 2018, Israel would bag a fourth win with the track Toy, performed by Netta. This stands are their most recent victory at the Contest.

The fourteenth country to win Eurovision is Germany. Despite having been on the inaugural nations to take part in the ESC, they wouldn’t win until 1982. Nicole was the artist to take them their, with ‘A Little Peace’ holding a special place amongst Eurovision fans for decades to come, including myself. 2010 would be the year in which they finally bagged a second victory, the song to do it being ‘Satellite’, performed by Lena. A bouncy catch ear-worm that isn’t going to leave your head for a while.

The fifteenth country to win Eurovision is Norway. For the longest time, they had the infamous reputation of coming last the most amount of times. That all changed in 1985, as they finally got their first win with the song ‘Let It Swing’, performed by Bobbysocks. 10 years later, it was Norway that broke up Ireland’s winning streak, briefly, by winning with ‘Nocturne’, a very strange song, performed by Secret Garden. In 2009, Alexander Rybak produced one of the highest-scoring results in Eurovision history at that time, with the song, ‘Fairytale’.

The sixteenth country to win Eurovision is Belgium. Similar to Germany, despite having been involved since the beginning, it would take 30 years before a win would bear the Belgian flag. The winner would be Sandra Kim, and her song, ‘J’aime le vie’. Whilst celebrations were due in Belgium, this win wasn’t without its critics. Mainly being centred around Sandra’s age, as she was 13 at the time, despite all the press lines saying she was 15. To this day, Sandra Kim is, and is likely to always be the youngest winner, of the Eurovision Song Contest.

The seventeenth country to win Eurovision is Yugoslavia. The Eastern European powerhouse had been a regular in the ESC since the 60s, but it wouldn’t be until 1989 before they would actually win. The song to do it would be ‘Rock Me’, performed by Riva. Some at the time claimed this song wasn’t a worthy winner, not that those in Yugoslavia cared, for this would be the only win they would gain, before dissolving during the early 90s.

The eighteenth country to win Eurovision is Estonia. Joining a long list of former Soviet Union states that were now able to join the ESC, Estonia would be the first of the Baltic states to win in 2001. Tanel Padar, Dave Benton & 2XL, performing the song, ‘Everybody’ would provide Estonia with their first, and so far only victory.

The nineteenth country to win Eurovision is Latvia, becoming the second of the Baltic States to win in 2002. Following on from Estonia’s victory the year before, ‘I Wanna’ performed by Marie N, would continue the trend that would run through the 2000s, of countries old and new to Eurovision finally securing a win at the Contest.

The twentieth country to win Eurovision is Turkey. They’d been taking part regularly since the 1970s, but a win had always seemed elusive. But the moment would finally arrive in 2003, where after a closely fought battle with Belgium and Russia, Turkey would seize victory with the song, ‘Everyway That I Can’, performed by Sertab Erener. A crowning moment for sure, but Turkey would not see another win at Eurovision, their latest year of participation being 2012. They are yet to return to the Contest.

The twenty-first country to win Eurovision is Ukraine, who managed to win during their second year of taking part, in 2004. Ruslana would be the artist to bring it home, delivering an instant classic in the form of the song, ‘Wild Dances’. Ukraine would continuously do well in the ESC, being the only country to consistently always qualify from the semi-finals and often find themselves within the Top 10. In 2016, a second victory would be acquired, with Jamala delivering the powerful and ethereal, 1944. Ukraine’s third and latest win would come in 2022, with Kalush Orchestra taking the trophy by performing their song, ‘Stefania’.

The twenty-second country to win Eurovision is Greece, bagging their first and so far only win more than 30 years from their debut in the ESC. 2005 would be their magical year, with Helena Paparizou performing the suitably titled, ‘My Number One’. Any victory in Eurovision is cause for celebration, though Greece, as like many others, have yet to win for a second time.

The twenty-third country to win Eurovision is Finland, who after years of poor results, finally won in 2006. Bet they didn’t just win with any kind of bog standard pop, for they’d take the trophy with the hard rock stylings, of Lordi. Hard Rock Hallelujah was unlike any winner Eurovision had seen before, and they still stand as one of the most legendary acts to grace the ESC stage. Finland have come close a few times since then, but so far, 2006 remains as their only win.

The twenty-fourth country to win Eurovision is Serbia. The first year they entered under their own name, they were able to secure the win, with the song ‘Molitva’, performed by Marija Šerifović. To date, this is their one and only ESC win, they have managed to come close a few times, including with this beauty.

The twenty-fifth country to win Eurovision is Russia. After many years of constantly finishing within the Top 5, Russia managed to claim a win at the Contest in 2008. The song was ‘Believe’, performed by Dima Bilan. Russia would continue to perform well in the Contest up until 2022, from which they would be banned, largely due to their invasion of Ukraine, a ban which remains in place to this day.

The twenty-sixth country to win Eurovision is Azerbaijan. Having debuted in the late 2000s, it wouldn’t take long before Azerbaijan won at the ESC, with their victory coming in 2011. ‘Running Scared’, performed by Ell and Nikki, would beat out all the other competitors, and it remains Azerbaijan’s one and only win, to this day.

The twenty-seventh country to win Eurovision is Portugal. Having taken part regularly since the 1960s, Portugal became one of the oldest countries in the ESC without ever taking the trophy home. This all finally changed in 2017, when the simple, but beautiful piano playing of Salvador Sobral, would see one of the highest-scoring wins ever, and the first-ever Portuguese win. The song of course, is ‘Amar pelos dois’ 

So 27 countries out of the 52 that have taken part at least once have managed to win the ESC. Will 2025 give us a 28th winner I wonder, would be the first new winner in 8 years if it did...

Let's look back at Eurovision 2015,1duatmg,61,"After Conchita Wurst won the contest in Copenhagen The contest after would be held in Austria

We had songs such as ""Tonight Again"", ""Rhythm Inside"", ""Love Injected"", ""Grande Amore"", ""Goodbye To Yesterday"", ""A Million Voices"", and of course ""Heroes"" which ended up Winning that year for Sweden


Although i can't think of a controversy that happened in 2015, i do want to talk about the stage this year. It's a cool stage but it's Small so most of the performance's this year didn't have any props on stage. The only one that comes to mind is Australia & Denmark

In my opinion Eurovision 2015 is my least favorite year mainly due to the small stage so not many countries managed to get props on stage. Most of the songs this year were very boring and forgettable. I do know that some people REALLY love this year but for me it was just very boring

1. [Ekklesia Sisters - ""Love and Let Go""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKARHpco2s) (MESC 2015). A group of six singing and dancing nuns with a hella catchy tune is that type of novelty act that's an absolute televote magnet at Eurovision.
2. [Saša Lendero - ""Mandoline""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-WQq4_nxwU) (EMA 2006). Would've easily given Slovenia its best result ever, it was by far the public favorite but the jury worked in shady ways at their selection that year.

Eurovision in Just Dance - A Rant,1djx1xh,13,"I am a Just Dance fan along with being a major fan of Eurovision, so whenever a Eurovision song or even a song by a Eurovision artist is announced to be in one of the games, I always die. Every. Single. Time. So with the announcement of Just Dance 2025, I'm writing this as a sort of manifestation for a Eurovision song to get into this year's edition (The Code and Dos Extranos from Benidorm Fest this year are both rumored to be in the game, but so were Tattoo and Unicorn back in 2023 and they didn't make it in).

Let's start at the very beginning then, shall we? The first song that can be related to the Eurovision Song Contests was on Just Dance 2. It was Big Girl (You Are Beautiful) by Eurovision 2022 co-host Mika. It was 2010, so the animation quite obviously wasn't great, and the choreo was quite repetitive, but I promise it gets better. Mika also appeared in Just Dance 3 with his song Lollipop, along with Satellite by Lena (Germany 2010), the winner of it's contest, which was a PAL exclusive song (Europe only).

After Just Dance 3, we had the GLORIOUSLY ICONIC game ABBA: You Can Dance featuring the music of the iconic band ABBA, who won Eurovision for Sweden in 1974. It does indeed include Waterloo, along with 25 of their other songs. It's a pretty solid game for Just Dance standards, although still very repetitive.

Just Dance 4 released a PAL version of Emma's (Italy 2014) Cercavo Amore, and it still remains one of my favorite dances (and if you want to stretch it with saying that the band Europe, who had minor cameos in ESC 2016 and had their song The Final Countdown featured in Just Dance 4, counts)! Just Dance 2014 brought along ABBA's (Sweden 1974) song Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight). It's okayish. Not the best, but pretty high up there in my ranking of the game's dances. You could also download the song My Main Girl by MainStreet, who competed in the Junior Songfestival 2012 to select the Dutch entry to the Junior Eurovision Song Contest. They came third in their national final.

Just Dance 2015 had Holding Out for a Hero by Bonnie Tyler, who represented the United Kingdom in 2013 with the song Believe In Me. Rita Ora, who was an interval act for Eurovision 2023, was also featured on the song Black Widow of the same game. Just Dance 2016 featured no Eurovision related artists.

In Just Dance 2017, Melodifestivalen 2017 interval act (can you tell I'm grasping at straws?) Zara Larsson's sogn Ain't My Fault was a featured song, and it's probably one of the best of the edition. Just Dance 2018's Just Dance Unlimited (paid subscription for a bunch of older songs and occasionally some new ones) saw Abba's (Sweden 1974) Dancign Queen grace the screen.

Just Dance 2019 is where it really starts picking up. Stella Mwangi (Norway 2011) had her song Not Your Ordinary featured as a track in the game. It was joined by Flo Rida's (San Marino 2021) Sweet Sensation and the controversial Netta's (Israel 2018) Eurovision winning song Toy. I would've been happier with Fuego, but I don't make the decisions at EBU. Zara Larsson is yet again featured, this time as a Just Dance Unlimited track with her song Lush Life.

On Just Dance 2020, we're paid visits from Netta's (Israel 2018) Bassa Sababa, Stella Mwangi's (Norway 2011) Ma Itū, and Little Big's (Russia 2020) Skibidi. Yes, the song is titled Skibidi. Ma Itū was by far the best track of the three, and is a banger, so you should check it out! Moving on to Just Dance 2021, we are finally given the iconic UNO by Little Big (Russia 2020), I was really rooting for this song to win. We also get the first of K3's many songs in Just Dance, this one being Dans van de Farao. Yet another stretch, K3 attempted to represent Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest 1999 with the song Heyah Mama. It obviously didn't make it to ESC, and K3, the ""flemish version of Spice Girls"", probably isn't going to be making a Eurovision comeback anytime soon. We also get Flash (Just Dance Version), one of the many singers on the song being Bilal Hassani, who represented France in 2019 with her song Roi.

Okay, 2022: we got Zara Larsson's Poster Girl on the main soundtrack and K3's Waterval on Just Dance unlimited. We also got the winner in our hearts of 2020, Daði Freyr (Iceland 2020 and 2021), and his song Think About Things from our missing 2020 year. I know I said that I was rooting for UNO, but I would have accepted this if it won also. Just Dance 2023 had the song Witch, which featured the withdrawn entry from Ukraine in 2022, Alina Pash. Just Dance Unlimited is also now replaced with Just Dance +, so keep that in mind.

Finally, we have made it to the latest game, Just Dance 2024. The main game only features yet another Zara Larsson song, this time Can't Tame Her, danced by Just Dance youtuber littlesiha (pretty famous in the Just Dance community). Just Dance made up for it with an entire season of Just Dance + dedicated to Eurovision! We got three iconic Eurovision songs: Euphoria by Loreen(Sweden 2012),  Trenulețul by Zdob și Zdub & Advahov Brothers (Moldova 2022), SloMo by Chanel (Spain 2022), and Give That Wolf A Banana by Subwoolfer (Norway 2022). Also featured was the song Beggin' by Måneskin, the winners of ESC 2021 for Italy. Just Dance's social media people held a vote for who the fans thought would have won the competition, and SloMo came out on top (obviously). I think it was a deserved win, it retains almost all of the on stage choreo from 2022!

EDIT: The Eurovision season was in the 2023 edition guys, screwed up big time

And that's it. Fingers crossed for Rim Tim Tagi Dim in Just Dance this year, folks!",1718839010.0,2024-06-20T09:16:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1djx1xh/eurovision_in_just_dance_a_rant/
What are some of your favourite Eurovision stagings and performance's?,1dh3whw,96,"What are some of your all time favourite Eurovision stagings and performance's? 

Some of my favourites are: 

Russia 2016: Lets be honest the song itself was nothing special, but the show and Sergey's performance totally made up for it

Sweden 2015: Heroes is just another Sweden radio friendly pop song, but the show and Mans energy and aura on the stage was so amazing. 

Spain 2022: What should i say? Im just a huge fan of good horeographies and dance's. And the lightning effects were so damn cool.

Slovenia 2019: Something totally diffrent now. I love Sebi in general. Its such a beautiful cute song.

"Most influential Performances of Modern Eurovision
",1d9gr5b,89,"I chose these performances based on the way they became influential to future trends in the Contest, and not based on their popularity, quality, result or my personal taste. Do you agree? Who do you miss? 

**1 - 1998 - Dana International - Diva**

Influence: Eurovision Diva / LGBTQ+ representation

I think this one is a no brainer. Dana opened many doors at Eurovision, not only as a trans woman, but also as the first “modern Eurovision diva” that I can recall. Countless divas and LGBTQ-friendly followed in her footsteps.

**2 - Latvia 2002 - Marie N - I Wanna**

Influence: Dress Reveal

Let’s be honest. “I Wanna” hasn’t aged well and it’s usually regarded as one of the most forgettable winners, but her dress reveal was truly shocking at the time and may as well be the main reason why she won. We had too many dress reveals since then to even count them.

**3 - Turkey 2003 - Sertab Erener - Everyway That I Can**

Influence: Ethnic Pop Banger

Looking at previous winners, this song stands out for bringing a new Eurovision sound: the “Ethnic Pop Banger.” Mixing ethnic sounds with pop music created a style that screams 2000s Eurovision. Just look at the 2004 and 2005 winners, and countless other acts in the following years.

**4 - Austria 2003 - Alf Poier - Weil der Mensch zählt**

Influence: Virality

There have been many joke entries in the past, but this is the first “modern joke entry” and arguably the first to become “viral” in the early internet days, even though that word probably didn’t exist back then. Its influence is evident in other joke entries such as Ireland 2008 or Spain 2008, just to name a couple.

**5 - Ukraine 2004 - Ruslana - Wild Dances**

Influence: Props

Ok, those battle horns at the beginning might only show up for a few seconds, but I think they were the stepping stone for all the prop craziness in the future Eurovision contests - from a man in a hamster wheel, to grannies baking bread. Add on top the tambourines and the leather jackets and you have probably the earliest prop reference in “Love, Love, Peace, Peace”. 

**6 - Sweden 2012 - Loreen - Euphoria**

Influence: Modern Staging

Euphoria was influential on many levels, but I include it here for its influence on modern staging. Previous years' performances feel like they were designed for the stage and then had TV camerawork added on top—feeling more televised than anything. Euphoria, however, feels like a music video—you can barely see the audience, the choreography is unique, and it almost doesn’t feel like it was live.

**7 - Sweden 2015 - Måns Zelmerlöw- Heroes**

Influence: Digital Props

As technology evolved, so did the way artists interact with the stage. Mans comes to mind first when I think of digital props and you can truly see the influence of this staging in future performances from Russia 2016 all the way to Cyprus 2024.

**8 - Ukraine 2016 - Jamala - 1944 / Portugal 2017 - Salvador Sobral - Amar Pelos Dois**

Influence: Non-English Entries

Since Molitva in 2007, all the Eurovision winners had been English songs. Jamala won by mixing English and Crimean Tatar and Salvador Sobral won with a Portuguese song. Ever since, countries have relied more and more on their national languages, to the point in which Azerbaijan just submitted its first Azeri song in 2024. Will Sweden go next?

**9 - Armenia 2016 - Iveta Mukuchyan - Lovewave**

Influence: Camera Work

While Euphoria created a new staging feel, Lovewave gave it a new spin with - arguably - the best camera work in the history of the Contest. This kind of work would have been impossible only a few years ago without the proper technology. Just look at how fast those cuts are and how well thought-out everything is. Although it has had a huge influence, I would say we haven’t seen such a good camera work until Ireland 2024.

**10 - Norway 2017 - Jowst - Grab the Moment**

Influence: Pre Recorded Vocals

With voice sampling becoming a huge factor in modern music production, it was only a matter of time that a song introduced pre recorded vocals. Jowst was given special permission by the EBU to feature vocal sampling in the chorus, which would have been impossible to replicate live. Although the official reason to allow pre recorded vocals after the pandemic was financial, I would say that this entry opened the doors for it.

**11 - Spain 2022 - Chanel - Slomo**

Influence: Dance Break

Chanel was not the first artist to have a dance break by any means. When she won Benidorm Fest in 2022, haters argued that the Eurovision Diva cliche was dead (just look at the 2021 bloodbath) and that Slomo was very similar to Fuego. Well, she proved them wrong. Her choreo was probably the hardest we had seen up to that point. In only 2 years since, we had a resurgence in dance breaks that have become increasingly more acrobatic (Armenia, Poland and Noa Kirel in 2023, Austria, Georgia and Malta in 2024) to the point that “the new Chanel” has become a cliche itself.

Time to go back to my regular Eurovision playlist... what country pops up most often for you?,1d69nvy,7,"Today is the first Sunday in the month after Eurovision which means it's time for a very important admin task for me: adding the current year's Eurovision songs to my playlist!

Currently it's on Spotify and I use it when I'm working from home or driving the car. Thought I'd do a bit of statistics for the first time (what else is there to do on Sunday night?) and see what years (and countries) are most highly represented... the results were very surprising. Important to note this is all at the mercy of Spotify (e.g. the recent ""Where's Luktelk?"" issue) and what is in their catalogue.

Below I got a bit carried away and categorised my entire Eurovision playlist, but the summary is:

* Denmark - 12 times
* Estonia, Sweden - 9
* Australia, Finland - 8
* Germany, Hungary, Lithuania, Spain - 7.

That said, Australia only have had 10 entries (and I am from Australia...). Very surprised about Estonia and moderately surprised with Sweden.

And who turned up once? Bosnia & Herzegovina (2011 - Love in Rewind), Luxembourg (this year), and Montenegro (2009).

And who doesn't show up at all? Interestingly, Turkey, Russia and Slovakia. I think that's a function of what's on Spotify though. I would include Horehronie or We Could Be The Same but I guess I need to go digging. For Russia, I'd probably have to go back to 2008 because I unironically like Believe, and I suppose their 2010 entry (Lost and Forgotten) and maybe Uno (2020) as well. 

**For anyone who had a spare... hour or so to calculate the above for yourself - any surprises? Also I will defend any inclusion/exclusion in my playlist if anyone feels sufficiently aggrieved/intrigued**

Now I should mention this isn't permanent, I have taken songs off and there are some songs I am considering taking off. But yeah... very surprised that only 8 songs from 2020 are in, 3 songs from 2010, and the like. 2024 is a very strong year but I expect to remove a few songs from the rotation in a few months, early candidates include Australia, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Norway, and Slovenia. (There are a few songs from older years I'm starting to get iffy about, but we'll see)",1717321236.0,2024-06-02T19:40:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1d69nvy/time_to_go_back_to_my_regular_eurovision_playlist/

Austria Grand Final Camera Error,1d3p4gn,25,"Does anyone have any news articles regarding the freezing and camera swap killing the dance scene in the grand final? trying to get it noted in wikipedia as it's arguably quite notable, even though it seems there's no attention to it!

Can anyone explain what was happening with Sweden/SVT/Melodifestivalen from 2007-2010?,1d2d05p,17,"We all know that Sweden's only NQ happened in 2010 when they finished 11th in the semifinals, and after that, they reclaimed their powerhouse status (immediately finishing top 3 in 2011 and winning in 2012, then winning again twice in 2015 and 2023). But after watching SchlagerLucas's updated video of Sweden's updated history of entries in Eurovision, I noticed that they were consistently on the right board for 3 straight years (2007, 2008, 2009) before their infamous NQ, which looks like the most un-Sweden thing to happen on Sweden in Eurovision.

So as written above, what was happening with Sweden/SVT/Melodifestivalen during this time? Was the eventual NQ their turning point and improvements happened in 2011, which launched them back to the left board?",1716878211.0,2024-05-28T16:36:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1d2d05p/can_anyone_explain_what_was_happening_with/
"More Drum and Bass, or EDM in general, at Eurovision in upcoming years?",1d1z5gz,23,"I've been following the contest since around 2015 when I was just 10, and without actively going back to look at previous years' entry lists, the only instances I can think of DnB being featured at Eurovision are Switzerland 2024, and Hungary 2014. 

So this year has been by far my favourite since I've started watching because of the noticeably increasing number of EDM entries, and I really do hope that we see more in future (not just 90s rave/eurodance-inspired though of course). 

Especially with Nemo's winning song itself this year incorporating Drum and Bass, do y'all think that we'll start to see a wider variety of EDM genres represented at the Contest from next year onwards?

Obviously they don't NEED to be accompanied by operatic vocals and an orchestral score, but I'd love to see more diverse electronic music genres - downtempo like Slovenia 2019, or hardcore Gabber like Netherlands 2024, but how about completely new genres to the contest like future bass or jungle or breakbeat? Hell, I would love some Electro Swing, Caravan Palace for France, anyone??",1716836566.0,2024-05-28T05:02:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1d1z5gz/more_drum_and_bass_or_edm_in_general_at/

I ranked every ESC Grand Final from 2010 to 2024 based on song packages!,1czh1sm,3,"I'm from Denmark and I've been following Eurovision either closely or loosely since 2012, and saw glimpses of 2011 and 2010 (I watched those 2 recently). I figured I should rewatch all these years and try to rank all of them, and also to try and understand if Eurovision has lost the simple song and melody, or if the current day songs simply just outshine the past.

**Now what I mean by song packages**, is the 25-27 songs that end up in the Grand Final, and rate the performances, which includes all the visuals of it aswell. Some songs may be better as the studio version, or they even improve live.

If this list was based on hosts and entertainment from the show, then Eurovision 2016 is perfect, but **this is exclusively about the songs**.

**Eurovision year (some notes about it) (one word to describe it):**

**Eurovision Malmö 2024** (beyond incredible visuals, arguably no bad performance, some performances could have been sung better, multiple winners) (**exceptional**)

**Eurovision Rotterdam 2021** (the new standard, incredible stage and visuals, legendary performances, but still a few weak songs) (**monumental**)

------------------------------------------

**Eurovision Vienna 2015** (production value is massively upgraded, some of the best performances of the last 10 years) (**artistic**)

**Eurovision Liverpool 2023** (sound mixing seems bad, generally very good songs, pretty solid stagings) (**diversity**)

**Eurovision Stockholm 2016** (extremely high highs otherwise very mediocre, incredible staging and visuals) (**revolutionary**)

------------------------------------------

**Eurovision Tel Aviv 2019** (some very message-heavy songs, some very memorable songs, still stuck in the 2010's musically) (**colorful**)

**Eurovision Turin 2022** (staging is weak for almost all songs, some fantastic songs, otherwise very mediocre) (**unity**)

**Eurovision Lisbon 2018** (good level for all the songs, barely any weak songs, very versatile stagings) (**passionate**)

------------------------------------------

**Eurovision Malmö 2013** (everything eurovision is known for, very solid, really fun show) (**quintessential**)

**Eurovision Copenhagen 2014** (much more electronic and visual, songs breaking out of the box) (**transitional**)

**Eurovision Düsseldorf 2011** (ton of variety, some great classics, staging modernized) (**evolution**)

**Eurovision Baku 2012** (so many party songs, quite a few dramatic ballads, modulations galore, fairly solid overall) (**grandeur**)

------------------------------------------

**Eurovision Kyiv 2017** (very happy and poppy, sounds like trends, visuals downgraded, some great songs inbetween) (**forgettable**)

**Eurovision Oslo 2010** (generally weak combined with very low lows, some pieces of gold) (**boring**)

------------------------------------------

**You might notice an extended gap**, which just means that I feel like two years are not that close together (2021 being much better than 2015 for example, while 2024 is only better than 2021)

I didn't try to be objective about it, it is mainly from own opinion, if you enjoy a lot of 2010's pop, then 2016 might be at the very top for you! (that year was also crazy good at the time).

Some contests were hard to find the right words for, either they came immediately to mind, or I had to search for the right word, it would be cool if anyone has a better word for them though!

Also if any heavily disagrees, then feel free to let me know what you disagree with, some years could move up or down a spot, but I generally feel good about this ranking.",1716544318.0,2024-05-24T19:51:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1czh1sm/i_ranked_every_esc_grand_final_from_2010_to_2024/
Was ORF (Vienna 2015) a bad host? (Genuine question),1cxfp07,37,"Hey! I know this might be a bit of a bizarre question but anyways... I've been watching the contest since 2008, but back in 2015 I didn't follow the Eurovision season half as much as I do nowadays, although I was starting to ever so slightly!

And because of that slight following that was growing on me I have a very blurry but very present in my mind memory of myself browsing through a Spanish TV forum, reading probably one of my first Eurovision season news. I went down to the comments and there were three, I'm 100% sure it was something like this but in Spanish:

1. \[Something about Eurovision being for gays and housewives\]
2. \[Can't remember but probably something about Edurne\]
   1. ""\[Can't remember but in response to the previous\] ...ORF are being awful hosts and messing everything up... \[can't remember\]

I'm almost almost certain that the comments were from way before the semi-finals.

However, since I didn't really go through the actual ""Eurovision season experience""™️, the 2015 show simply felt quite nice and well-organized to me. But ever since then I've wondered why that person said that ORF's hosting was that bad. It just came across my mind once more and I finally decided to ask here!

Was there some sort of huge drama in Vienna 2015 involving ORF's hosting, or any drama at all? I've not seen anyone criticise them in here (whereas RAI feels like the sub's punching bag after 2022), so I'm wondering if it was just that person being angry about Edurne or something.

Eurovision 2024 results using the voting system used between 2009-2012,1cvm84d,1,"Here are my calculations for the results of Eurovision 2024 using the ""combined score"" system used between 2009 to 2012. Someone already made a list using the 2013 to 2015 system, so I'm putting my list here:

1. Switzerland (313 points)
2. Croatia (306 points)
3. Ukraine (247 points)
4. France (235 points)
5. Israel (192 points)
6. Ireland (147 points)
7. Italy (144 points)
8. Armenia (89 points)
9. Sweden (78 points)
10. Portugal (61 points)
11. Greece (49 points)
12. Luxembourg (35 points)
13. Cyprus (35 points)
14. Germany (34 points)
15. Lithuania (33 points)
16. Latvia (25 points)
17. Serbia (25 points)
18. Estonia (17 points)
19. Finland (16 points)
20. Georgia (15 points)
21. United Kingdom (13 points)
22. Spain (13 points)
23. Slovenia (12 points)
24. Austria (9 points)
25. Norway (3 points)

Switzerland would still win, but with a narrower difference from Croatia, the runner-up. In addition, A lot of the points had went to the top 11, with the other 14 getting meager amounts of points from a few countries at best (Most egregiously, all of Slovenia's points would come from one country, Croatia).

Other than that, there isn't much changes in the final placements, aside from the UK dropping 3 places (perhaps due to the 0 points from the televote). The positions still wouldn't change even if Rest of the World votes were added.",1716118446.0,2024-05-19T21:34:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1cvm84d/eurovision_2024_results_using_the_voting_system/
2024 Old voting system results,1ct9su7,77,"Hello All,

I calculated the Eurovision 2024 results based on the 2013-2015 voting system. In this system the jury and televoting rankings were combined and resulted in only 1 set of 58 points (1-8, 10, 12).

For this result I made 1 exception: I also added the Rest of the World votes.

There are cleary some changes, but not very shocking. Only Norway is no longer finishing last.

Your favourite avant-garde Eurovision entries and why,1ct0u5j,90,"With the top 10 songs this year containing two pretty avant-garde songs, I thought I'd ask people on this sub to share their favourites from past editions. By avant-garde, I don't mean wacky, I mean the kind of songs that make you think ""what the hell was that?"" the first time you hear them, or even ""did that really happen at Eurovision?"" 

I will talk about my favourites, although I admit some recency bias. It would be good if people could point me to some older entries that fit the brief.

First, there's [Lock Me In](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zXiZAbqETvk) by Circus Mircus. It might not be the most shocking thing outside of a Eurovision context, but imo it is very different to any Eurovision song I can think of. It's fairly often brought up as a 'robbed' entry, but I've played it to people before and they've said ""what the hell was that?"" The band's manifesto includes the statement 'Genre is for the weak'. I think it counts as avant-garde.

Next, there's Finland's entry from 2015 [Aina mun pitää](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=v4Y0HOPL5GU) by Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät. It's a hardcore punk song by a band who all have developmental disabilities protesting against the conditions of their residential care. I don't think I need to say any more to show that the song is avant-garde.

Then there's [Let 3](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hGuGfdEJ5Pw) from last year. The BBC commentary described it as 'Croatian Monty Python', which I don't think quite does it justice, but it is subversive in a similar way to Monty Python. I love it.

I will also count Sébastien Tellier's 2008 entry for France, [Divine](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CZQjBCvFd9E) simply because it did stop people in their tracks at the time. I don't know if it still sounds as weird now, but it has that quality of being an enjoyable song to listen to, even if you don't know why. I think it might get nul points if it was done today, with the quality of entries and the polish that's expected, but oh well.

The most avant-garde (though I would never say it's the best) of the 4 songs Serge Gainsbourg wrote for Eurovision, is [this one](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JC_hw_9AIqU) for Monaco in 1967. It's deliberately terrible. It's barely even a song, more like a racket. The lyrics seem to be about living it up before we all die in a nuclear war. It somehow managed to come in 5th place.

I wanted to include Hatari (Iceland 2019) because I think what they did was very avant-garde. I got downvoted to oblivion once when I said I loved the song but didn't especially care about their political opinions. I can't leave them out though because the whole thing was so clever as well as being great EBM.

Other songs that I think are pretty avant-garde are: Serbia from 2022, Portugal from 2019 and arguably Telex for Belgium in 1980. That last one wasn't really musically innovative despite what some people say, but that level of sarcasm and the fact that it's meta was unique at the time, I think?",1715821225.0,2024-05-16T11:00:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1ct0u5j/your_favourite_avantgarde_eurovision_entries_and/
What are your unpopular favourites?,1csiem7,705,"Does anyone else seem to have an affinity for losing songs?

I don’t know what it is, maybe my taste in music just isn’t as good as I’d like to think, but it feels like every year some of my top 5 end up in the bottom 5 or not even qualifying, and some of my all time favourite Eurovision songs are regularly deemed amongst the worst. On the other hand, the songs that eventually win are rarely in my top five or ten, with the exception of just a few.

Eurovision theme music,1cqa88z,5,"Hello everyone, 

I'm looking for the instrumental versions of the theme music (eg the music you'd expect them to play in a loop if the life broadcast is down for any reason) of last and past eurovisions in spotify, but I have a hard time finding them (if they even exist).

I'll add the 2015 one as an exemple (best one of all imo). Can't find this one either in Spotify.

Ranking The Top 52 Eurovision Song Contest Countries since 1975: The Top 10!,1co3hs4,4,"Into the Top 10!!! These countries have shown (at least sometimes) that they are the best of the best when it comes to Eurovision. Many of the most iconic acts in the last half century are thanks to these nations, so without further ado, let's start the end of this countdown!

## The Countries

| Placement | Country         | Score      |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------- |  
| 6	    | Ukraine         | 228297.535 |
| 7	    | Ireland 	      | 212432.017 |
| 8	    | France	      | 198317.935 |
| 9	    | Israel	      | 192954.086 |
| 10	    | Greece	      | 182795.193 | 

These countries bring the heat! In 10th, we have Greece, who honestly wouldn’t be this high on the list if we stopped at the year 2000. Their surge in the 21st century has vaulted them up into the top 10, delivering iconic performance after iconic performance, especially in the 2000s, which occupies 4 of their top 5 slots. Above them is Israel… who, let’s face it, have been associated with controversy, to put it lightly, ever since they joined in 1973.  But there is a reason why I’m only talking about them now, because even if you don’t like it, you cannot tell the story of ESC without them, as they have made their mark in this competition. Above them is our 3rd Big 5 entrant, in France, who were the rulers of early Eurovision. Their influence has waned in the decades since their last victory, but you can never count out the French, as their top entry will show you. In 7th is Ireland, whose story you know well at this point. The only country to 3 peat, and one of two countries to have a person win multiple ESC trophies, their run in the 80s and 90s will probably never be matched again in this contest. It’s the reason they are so high, but it’s also the reason why their best entries are from the opposite side of this millennium. And in 6th, just missing out on the top 5, is Ukraine, who since joining in 2003, have raised the bar at ESC. They are the youngest country (Eurovision wise) to be up here, and after I show you their best entries, you’ll see why.

## The Worst Years

### France | 2014 | [Twin Twin - Moustache](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjkqciwP034)
***Contest Ranking***: 26th (last, 2 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 37th (0.553)

France has only finished last at Eurovision once. Once. This was it. A song about having everything that one could want, but still needing more (especially a mustache). This song has its moments, but man, the plagiarism in this song is only the least of its problems here. Maybe France should have wished for a beard instead, considering who was on top this year. 

### Israel | 1996 | [Galit Bell - Shalom Olam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv5xnCN5VBk)
***Contest Ranking***: DNQ (28th qualifying round, 12 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 29th (0.809)

Israel was up and down in the 90’s. They would start the decade finishing 18th, only to finish 3rd the following year. In ‘93 they would place 24th, and in ‘94 they would place 8th. This entry wouldn’t even make the final cut of ESC, falling in the audio only qualifier. If you only listen to the video, you can see why, it’s just boring. The next time Israel would compete though would be a lot less boring… 

### Ireland | 2007 | [Dervish - They Can't Stop the Spring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N40wpl5m0UM)
***Contest Ranking***: 24th (last, 5 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 38th (0.874)

Ireland’s slow, painful descent towards being irrelevant started here, if we are looking at results only. It probably started when the RTE didn’t want to host ESC again in ‘97, which slowly led to being complacent and such, but I digress. If you look at just the song, it’s not that bad. If you look at the live performance, you can see why this finished last. It’s like Ireland just stopped caring about ESC, and after this year, that really starts to show. In the 16 years after 2007, Ireland would only qualify 5 times, which is just one more than their win total from 1993-1997. 

### Greece | 2023 | [Victor Vernicos - What They Say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL0EkId_sTY)
***Contest Ranking***: DNQ (13th 2nd Semi Final, 14 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 31st (0.986)

Coming off of strong entries in 2021 and 2022 , Greece wanted to continue their post pandemic success, considering that their pre pandemic entries weren’t as great. They would select a solo male performer, which they last did in 2009. In 2009, they finished 7th, in 2023, they would not even qualify, continuing the late 2010s trend of struggling to make a mark at this competition. 



### Ukraine | 2017 | [O.Torvald - Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KWZ4CKapPA)
***Contest Ranking***: 24th (36 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 24th (8.798)

This was the only time Ukraine has finished outside the top 20 in their history at ESC. Usually their performance drops off a bit when they have hosting duties, as was the case with this entry. Even in years that they “underperform”, Ukraine still tries to do something different, like in this song. I especially like the ticking clocks on the singers that count down to 1, then tick back up. I mean the song is about time, after all. 


## The Best Years

### Ireland | 1994 | [Paul Harrington and Charlie McGettigan - Rock 'n' Roll Kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x_9JnCGXFY)
***Contest Ranking***: ***1st*** (226  pts)  
***My Ranking***: ***1st*** (532.439**)

In my opinion, this was the peak of Ireland at Eurovision. During their infamous 90s run, Ireland just couldn’t lose, and this entry is the prime example of it. After winning the contest back to back in ‘92 and ‘93, Ireland already joined Spain, Luxembourg, and Israel as the only countries to win the contest consecutively. A popular myth associated with this year is that Ireland didn;t want to win, due to the infamous costs of hosting this competition. That is obviously not true, but it would be ironic that their best entry ever would be one that was deliberately chosen to NOT win. The RTE chose artists Paul Harrington and Charlie McGettigan to perform a piano duet in Dublin, called “Rock 'n' Roll Kids”.  
 
Why is this song the best Irish ESC song? Why not Johnny Logan, who took part in three of Ireland’s seven victories? Why not Niamh Kavanagh, who delivered one of the great Eurovision ballads? Why not Elmear Quinn, who was responsible for Ireland’s last victory? Well dear reader, I think the answer lies, of course, in the song. “Rock 'n' Roll Kids is a song longing for the good old days of youth, evoking a sense of nostalgia. The performance felt authentic, as they sell the emotions of this song well. The song’s also very simple, as it was the only entry that night to not use an orchestra. It only features a piano and a guitar, both played by the performers. And as well as all of that, the song is very slow, allowing the audience to be absorbed into the atmosphere of this entry. It also helps that the performers harmonize incredibly well, of course. Between this entry and the [interval act](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy79KKpQ988), Ireland could do no wrong at ESC. This was at the peak of the RTE caring about this contest, and even though they would win again two years later, this was when Ireland were on top at Eurovision (it was the record leading 6th win), and in the years since, they have slowly declined from that peak.

### France | 2021 | [Barbara Pravi - 	Voilà](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kiyXRhIXWU)
***Contest Ranking***: *2nd* (499 pts)  
***My Ranking***: *2nd* (533.241**)

Since the early 2000s, France’s success at ESC has been middling at best. It doesn’t help that their chanson format, which helped them gain 5 wins, kinda lost its power around the 90s. They had 2 big chances at the start of the 90s to claim another victory, but unfortunately Italy had too much experience uniting Europe, and [tie breakers were not on their side](https://youtu.be/S35W5gt8Z_o?si=tp-U9rRdB_wE7Clm&t=4838). In the years since, France has had trouble trying to regain their former glory in modern times, but then comes 2021. France has gone back and forth on internal selections and national finals, and for 2019 and 2020 they opted for the former, but after COVID, they went back to a national final, called C’est vous qui decidez. From that national final came Barbara Piévic, known better as Barbara Pravi. Barbara has had a prolific songwriting career up until this point, having written for several artists, including Jaden Smith and Yannick Noah, among others. She also wrote for Valentina Tronel and Carla Lazzari, two Junior ESC participants, with the former winning with the song “J’imagine” in 2020. So safe to say that she has experience writing winning songs! In 2021, she would compete in France’s national final, and as said before would win that final with the song “Voilà”.  
    
“Voilà'' is so French it hurts, but it showcases the power the language still has in modern day Eurovision. It’s a song about self acceptance for Pravi, showcasing her in a delicate and fragile manner. The song mixes old school French chanson with a modern production, something that France has been missing for several, several, several years. This is how you make a French ballad, retaining its raw and emotional aspects without boring everyone to death  It’s meant to tell a rich, provocative story (in 3 minutes or less), and Pravi’s almost Edith Pilaf style creates that story and some, and her live performance really ties it all together. TLDR, this song is really good, if Italy didn’t exist this would have won (just like 1990, le sigh).

### Israel | 2018 | [Netta - Toy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CziHrYYSyPc)
***Contest Ranking***: ***1st*** (529 pts)  
***My Ranking***: ***1st*** (565.656**)

The most viral Israliean entry ever, and their first winner in the 21st century! By 2017, Israel were swimming in the pool of Eurovision mediocracy, as they would have small feats of success (2015) surrounded by meh entries. In 2017, Israel would host the fifth edition of their national selection show (HaKokhav HaBa), and the artist that would get the call to go to Lisbon for ESC would be Netta Barzilai, after performing various mashups of popular songs like “Gangnam Style” and “Tik Tok”. Netta is a singer-songwriter, but what she specializes in is electronic music, as she studied it at university. In particular, Netta is a DJ, which means that she can combine various beats/sounds together to create magic, which is what her song for ESC is.  
   
This song is… quite something. When I first heard it, I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, especially the chicken noises before the first chorus. But this song is actually genius the more I listen to it. This entry is an electronic women empowerment anthem during the #MeToo movement, and it conveys that message of empowerment in such a unique way! The sound is very “unconventional”, incorporating pop, ethnic, and electronic music. This song embraces how different it is, chicken noises and all, because it’s all about being independent, not being someone’s toy (get it?), and being free to do whatever one pleases, which may include random noises.  I think the live performance sells it as well, as Netta oozes confidence and charisma, which is needed for a song like this one. Let me put it like this, you come for the chicken noises, but you stay for the message (and catchiness) of the song. It also helps that Netta is a good singer too, but that’s obvious. Until “Uno” in 2020, the music video for this song was the most viewed video on the official ESC youtube channel, a testament to Netta’s strategy. Her success here has vaulted her career, but for Israel, her success made sure that Eurovision was going to Jerus- I mean Tel Aviv for the first time! (Surely nothing controversial was the cause of that change)


**This entry is one of the ***Top 50*** ESC songs since 1975. 


### Greece | 2004 | [Sakis Rouvas - Shake It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asZwDUTEXls)
***Contest Ranking***: *3rd* (252 pts)  
***My Ranking***: *3rd* (578.748**)

2004 was a weird statistical outlier year. The top 3 in this contest all scored above 200 points, so when adjusting for how many countries voted, the top 3 are VERY high in the all time ranks. For one of those countries, I can’t even talk about them, because they have a BIGGER statistical outlier that ranks higher, and we’ll get to that. But for Greece, this came during their 2000’s renaissance! The country was on a downwards spiral to end the 90s, but then 2001 came and changed everything. Antique’s 3rd place finish, the highest placement ever for Greece, sparked a revitalization of how the country thinks about ESC. A couple of 17th place finishes later, we have Sakis Rouvas, a former athlete turned musician who has a knack of creating smash hits. He already had 2 prior to 2004, but his next one would shatter records, both inside and outside Eurovision.  
     
I can see why this song scored so high, but not as high as the top 2. It is incredibly danceable (I mean the song is literally called “Shake It”), appealing to men and women everywhere, and the song itself is very catchy, if not a bit simple. At the end of the day, the more simple song placed underneath the two more interesting songs (Ukraine and S+M). Greece were fully enveloped in their viral phase, which would pay off one year later, but it’s very nice to see the country do so well, they have been starving for success ever since they joined in 1974. There’s not much else I have to say about this song, except that this song would go on to be the best selling CD singles of all time in Greece, an achievement to show how far this country has come in this competition. 

** This entry is one of the ***Top 50*** ESC songs since 1975. 


### Ukraine | 2022 | [Kalush Orchestra - Stefania (Стефанія)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiEGVYOruLk)
***Contest Ranking***: ***1st*** (631 pts)  
***My Ranking***: ***1st*** (842.121**)

And now the song that I don’t know what to make of. But first, a little about the Kalush Orchestra. This group was founded in 2021 as a side project of the rap group Kalush, forming a more folk-hip hop group. They competed for the right to go to Turin for ESC  in 2022, but ended up finishing second to Alina Pash. So they weren’t able to go, right? Well, about that,  Pash had to withdraw from the contest due to her travel history in the region of Crimea, which has been the reason for some artists’ withdrawal in the past. So the broadcastor went to second place Kalush Orchestra to ask them if they were willing to take Pash’s place, to which they obliged.     

This song was seen as a favorite, but not the main favorite to win it all. That changed when in late February, Russia began their invasion of Ukraine. The song, which was about an ode to one’s mother, suddenly took on a whole new meaning as bombs were raining on the band’s native land. This song became more than just a Eurovision entry, it became an anthem, a mournful song about what has been lost but also hopeful of the future. I might be blabbing a bit, so let me talk about the contest and the results. This song overwhelmingly won with the televote, scoring the highest percentage (94%) of points from a televote ever, which is why this song ranks so high. For me, this entry represents a side of ESC that I haven’t talked about much, which is Eurovision as a political tool. There have been many political entries in this competition, with some making the Grand Final stage while others get canned due to their political messaging. This song at its heart isn’t political, but what it represents is “political”, in the sense that war is political or something like that. For some participants, Eurovision is a platform to demonstrate their country’s culture, while for others Eurovision is a platform to send a message, whether political or not. You see the latter with Kalush Orchestra, as after their Grand Final performance they called for aid in their home country of Ukraine. Could this song have won if Russia didn’t invade Ukraine? Maybe, it definitely would have been closer with the UK and Spain. Would Kalush Orchestra and Ukrainians glady trade their ESC win for peace for their country? Of course they would. I really don’t know what point I’m trying to make here, so I’ll end it like this. “Stefania” is unlike any of the other top 50 entrants due to the background and circumstances surrounding it. But it does represent an important facet of Eurovision, which is that it serves as a platform to relay a message, any message, and that is what this entry is.

Semi-final 2: Why your favourite will make it (and why they might not),1cnwrlp,42,"Tonight is one of the strongest semi-finals of all time, with sixteen sensational acts taking to the stage to compete for the final slots in the final. But which ten will rave again on Saturday night, and which six will be gone before the party is over? [Back by popular demand](https://new.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1cma72v/semifinal_1_why_your_favourite_will_make_it_and/), here's my tongue-in-cheek look at everybody's chances tonight. As ever, please **don't take anything here too seriously,** and remember I'm writing this as a regular Eurovision fan lost in the excitement, confusion, hopium and copium of Eurovision euphoria, not as a mod.

**Malta**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * Colourful, energetic, an ideal opener
   * Sarah is brilliant - she can dance, she can sing, having the time of her life!
   * Impressive wow moments in the choreography which stand out even after every song has performed
   * It's basically a better version of what Cyprus was going for on Tuesday. Cyprus qualified, why not Malta?
* *Why they might not:*
   * Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but it doesn't often work very well at Eurovision (i.e. Iceland 2016 after Sweden 2015). The comparisons with Slomo do not help her
   * Malta is one of the countries most disadvantaged by televote only semifinals, with no reliable diaspora partners and most frequent supporters UK & Ireland not voting in this semi
   * Facing stiff 'girlbop' competition from Austria, Georgia and arguably Greece

**Albania**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * One of Albania's more contemporary songs in years
   * Basically a perfect draw for optimum diaspora support, with Italy, Greece, ROW and Switzerland all guaranteed to award high points, and likely smaller points from many others
   * Besa will only be able to give us more wholesome insights into the ESC 2024 artists groupchat if she's still around - she must be protected at all costs!
   * Even if she fall, she gon' get up, standing tall proud with her head up
* *Why they might not:*
   * Having great diaspora support didn't help Poland on Tuesday
   * Far too many ideas going on both musically and on stage makes this quite a mess
   * The dreaded curse of the #2 strikes again

**Greece**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * Has captured the hearts and hopes of a nation, blending urban and folk sounds perfectly
   * Standout colourful stage graphics and clever choreography, including a one-camera-shot gimmick
   * TA TA TA TA TA TA
   * Appeals to the small yet noteworthy 'butler' diaspora with impressive display of handkerchief choreography
* *Why they might not:*
   * Queen Marina is currently ill with a fever according to Greek media, and may struggle to have the energy and vocals to carry this song
   * Filming the majority of the performance from one camera-angle leads to moments where the performance feels flat and lacking in dynamism
   * Domestic popularity does not always translate to international support

**Switzerland**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * One of the most engaging and endearing performers of the year, with perfect vocals and immense live energy
   * Staging taken from the Gjon's Tears playbook of 'stick our performer on random geometry', which somehow still works brilliantly
   * Performance full of clever lighting and wow moments
   * The prop brings back warm nostalgic memories of watching Beyblades as a kid for many viewers
* *Why they might not:*
   * Staging taken from the Gjon's Tears playbook of 'stick our performer on random geometry', which fails to fully convey the story of the song and lacks the creativity of the music video
   * A musical-theatre style genre-blend of opera, rap and drum & bass is far from the most digestible song, especially on first listen
   * Big Bird's gay cousin is writing a petition to ban Nemo as we speak for unsolicited use of his feathers
   * Agent Smith emerges from the Matrix to capture Nemo for breaking the code

**Czechia**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * Vocals were the main reason most people were writing this off, and Aiko has been significantly better in dress rehearsals so far
   * Many stories of fans' casual friends and workplaces loving this song a lot more than fan polls have indicated
   * The nipple bra is now gone, replaced with a more tasteful red one!
   * Aikonation could be this year's Aijanation
* *Why they might not:*
   * Whilst pretty, the staging concept of the dancers representing the five stages of grief is not at all explicit and doesn't aesthetically match the musical genre
   * The revamped bridge is bizarre and doesn't really work
   * Stiff competition with San Marino and Norway for rock-lover's votes

**Austria**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * Clever lighting and funky lasers match the techno sound and give the staging its own unique atmosphere
   * Very catchy chorus and polished choreography
   * One of the most physically attractive artists of the year, which will surely result in at least a few votes
   * Kaleen = Kalush + Loreen. Illuminati confirmed
* *Why they might not:*
   * Shaky vocals throughout - Tuesday's qualifiers show that Europe is not feeling particularly forgiving towards weak vocals this year
   * Whilst beloved in the fandom, could well be the 'fan-hype' of the year, with its dated sound not necessarily impressing casuals
   * I'm still ram-di-dam-don't think they fully understand what a rave is (i.e. not a fun steamy time with a bunch of shirtless men in a garage)

**Denmark**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * One of the most meme-able titles and choruses of the year - SAND! SAAAND!
   * Easily Denmark's most competitive song in years, and conventional pop will appeal to a broad audience
   * Probably significant number of Danes in attendance will lift this live
* *Why they might not:*
   * A disappointing lack of sand on stage and on visuals, on top of a generally static performance
   * Being accessible, conventional pop can be a double-edged sword, making this easy to overlook in a strong line-up
   * They've missed the opportunity to do a Dune tribute and have a giant sandworm eat Saba at the end of the performance, leaving 'bits and pieces lying everywhere'

**Armenia**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * One of the most charismatic performers of the year in Jaklin, who owns the camera and the stage
   * Colourful, fun staging
   * Sounds nothing like anything else this year, standing out well in the line-up
* *Why they might not:*
   * The song is very repetitive and feels surprisingly flat in the arena as a result
   * The band aren't able to play their instruments live which makes it a bit less impressive
   * WHERE IS THE CHICKEN??

**Latvia**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * Dons always gives an *eggcellent* performance vocally
   * Tuesday's qualifiers shows that Europe is down for voting for ballads this year, and there is very little ballad competition in this semi
   * Latvia is one of the ultimate underdogs at the moment, and everybody loves an underdog
* *Why they might not:*
   * The giant donut prop does nothing to add to visual storytelling, and Dons' emoting also isn't all that convincing
   * The song is sadly too forgettable in such a strong semi
   * Dons may take vengeance for months of egg jokes by bringing a pack of eggs on stage to throw at the audience

**San Marino**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * Some of the most creative, engaging and entertaining stage graphics of the entire year
   * The full kitchen sink thrown at the staging, with costume changes, clever camerawork, pyro, and presumably the entire bank account of a rich Sammarinese businessman behind them
   * Although San Marino lack voting allies, this year they have both Spain and Italy voting in the semi when Italy has historically given them *some* televotes in the semi and the band is Spanish
   * We didn't suffer through the painful mess of Una Voce per San Marino for nothing
* *Why they might not:*
   * Facing stiff competition from Norway and Czechia for rock-lovers
   * It's San Marino, who *always* struggle in the televote unless they have a certain Turkish man to draw in diaspora and drunk support.
   * Spanish rock representing San Marino may be a bit confusing for first-time viewers

**Georgia**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * Nutsa is probably the best vocalist of the entire semi, belting out the tune flawlessly whilst dancing
   * Never underestimate the wide appeal of a woman singing an ethnic-tinged bop with a load of pyro on stage
   * Everybody loves an underdog, and Georgia is one of the biggest Eurovision underdogs at the moment. Surely they break their streak this time?
* *Why they might not:*
   * Facing stiff 'girlbop' competition from Austria, Malta and arguably Greece
   * A great performance and a decent song hasn't always lead to a Georgian qualification (cries in Iru)
   * The 'fire' that Nutsa is 'putting out' seems to be the sun (see the stage graphics), which is inadvisable and would exhaust all life on Earth

**Belgium**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * One of the most instant songs of the year, and one of the only ballad-like songs in the semi
   * Has consistently ranked well in a variety of fan polls, demonstrating widespread appeal
   * Some atmospheric and effective moments in the staging, especially early on and with the platform of mics
* *Why they might not:*
   * Consistently wonky vocals, especially in the the falsetto choruses which are for many people the best part of the song
   * Incredibly disappointing and underwhelming staging, especially given the music video seemed tailor-made to translate onto the stage
   * The ending is repetitive and lacks power in a live setting

**Estonia**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * Quirky and pure fun in a way which should appeal to televoters
   * Great late draw
   * One of the most recognisable and imitable dance moves of the year, beloved by the audience who will lift this song
   * Our community hasn't produced countless memes and fan-art pieces for nothing, right? Right?! UUUUUUUUUUUU YYYYYYYYYYYEEEAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH intensifies
* *Why they might not:*
   * Incredibly messy and unimaginative staging are drawbacks you can't afford in a semi this competitive
   * Could well be the subreddit fan-hype of the year as Estonian folk/hip-hop mix is potentially a niche genre for a casual audience
   * The police investigation concludes that in the end they (really) *do* know quite a lot about (those) drugs

**Israel**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * Flawless vocals, one of the only ballads in the semi
   * Great late draw
   * Some effective staging moments, especially with atmospheric use of dry ice
   * The boos and criticism will only encourage some voters to vote even more for them
* *Why they might not:*
   * Maybe far more of Europe feels uncomfortable about Israel's participation at the moment than we all suspect
   * Eden risks getting oxymated slightly in the dry ice
   * Lack of audience support may influence voters at home

**Norway**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * Purely a magical experience from start to finish (#unbiasedjournalism)
   * Musically full of wow moments, especially the intense final chorus and Gunhild's impeccable vocals
   * Effective use of dry ice and lasers to add to the moody atmosphere
   * Everybody loves a good fairytale!
* *Why they might not:*
   * Folk-rock could be too niche of a genre for a widespread casual audience, and the song is facing competition from other rock songs in the semi for votes
   * The staging is a bit of a downgrade from MGP, lacking some of the intimacy and effective pre-recorded inserts
   * Gunhild may accidentally pull a muscle doing her famous leaning back trick
   * The lyrics may summon a werewolf who eats the stage, disqualifying the band

**Netherlands**

* *Why they will make it:*
   * Creative and witty stage graphics and impeccable live energy from Joost
   * Perfect draw position
   * Incredibly effective ending which gives added poignancy to the performance
* *Why they might not:*
   * When you promise innovative, never-before seen staging and bring a bloke in a blue bird costume, you are going to rub people up the wrong way
   * Focussing entirely on the sad ending in all recaps may feel like using tragedy for cynical gain, instead of presenting the balance the song gives
   * Brexit means Brexit - Eurosceptics may unite to overturn this EU propaganda!!

Whatever happens tonight, remember to have fun - at the end of the day it's just a song contest. Enjoy the performances, and may all your favourites qualify!",1715259787.0,2024-05-09T23:03:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1cnwrlp/semifinal_2_why_your_favourite_will_make_it_and/
🎙️ [Live Commentary] Semi-final 2: Dress Rehearsal 1 @ 15:45 CEST,1cn4abd,212,"The first ten qualifiers have been decided. Today, the media, accredited fan press and later this evening the first live audience get to watch the second semi-final in full. Our team also has accreditation and will be covering both dress rehearsals today for you to enjoy!

# How will this coverage work?

The format will stay the same as on Monday. In this afternoon's thread, we will be trialling running our commentary a new way. I will be updating this thread after each performance with my rough thoughts on each rehearsal, with some additional thoughts and comments from some of the other mods too. **Please keep refreshing this thread - new updates will be added to the bottom of the OP roughly every four minutes!**

For this evening's jury show/dress rehearsal 2/evening preview, we will be covering the rehearsal **via** [**Reddit Live**](https://www.reddit.com/live/1cyt7kyzosm3o/) **like we did last year**. This will allow you to read a variety of voices and thoughts on the performances.

\_\_\_

**15:47CEST:** The stream is now live! The show will begin with a recap of the first semi which is yet to be edited.

**15:49CEST:** After a short intro where Malin and Petra parody Tattoo and its staging from inside tanning cubicles, our hosts open up the show, a lot faster than for the first semi! We missed a skit in the first bit due to stream lag, but seems there's a joke about France/Italy/Spain all performing in the semi. Malin is in a yellow-pink short dress and Petra in a regal red gown. The press in attendance give a warm round of applause and the show begins!

**Song 1: Malta**

**Postcard:** The songs of choice are 1998 and 2021. Sarah is enjoying the outdoors in Malta, including a moment with a cockatoo!

**Performance:** Sarah is a little weak vocally but it sounds to me like she's saving her vocals, apart from the massive note at the end which she nails! Stream lagged for the second verse sadly so we missed it - before that there's a lot of green graphics which I'm not sure have been seen much in the galleries. Sarah is clearly enjoying herself and hitting the cameras well. Some of the camerawork is clever, but there's still a lot of wide and panning shots. A decent opening all things considered.

**Song 2: Albania**

**Postcard:** Afraid my internet is really not having a fun time, so we missed the first song in the postcard, but of course 2012 is the other one.

**Performance:** Besa has another new costume! A kind of aquamarine blue-green dress with a hood - it's better than the weird astronaut costume she first chose but I think I prefer the second rehearsal one. The stage feels so big and empty in this one and it's hard to put into words given there is a lot going on, from dancers who are stood in front of Besa, to hands and other dancers on the backdrop and stage floor. She encourages the audience to sing along in the first chorus. Vocally she's fine apart from a couple of duff vocal acrobatics at the end, but I think what's going on is distracting more than helping to amplify the song. She looks pleased with herself as she leaves the stage.

**Song 3: Greece**

**Postcard:** 1974 and 2005 are the songs of choice! Marina is enjoying the city, with images of classical Greek statues of course.

**Performance:** The performance starts of in a trimmed aspect radio like it's an instagram or tiktok video with heart emojis rising on screen. The main kicker here is whether the single camerashot works. It's working for fellow mod CaptainAnaAmari, but I'm a lot less convinced - it doesn't match the energy of the choreography for me. She's also pretty weak vocally, ever so slightly flat throughout. We finally get a different camerashot in the last minute with a really cool ceiling shot which goes inside one of the cubes, and then we get more conventional camerawork, with lots of wide shots and and panning shots. The stage is really pretty and colourful on the whole.

**Technical Issues:** Unfortunately, we've lost access to the livestream due to refreshing the stream too many times to combat stream freezing. We're trying to regain access at the moment by contacting the help desk but I'm afraid we're going to miss quite a few songs. We caught a very small bit of Switzerland, which confirms Nemo does indeed have a slightly different costume - it's still pink and furry, but with more of a collar if that makes sense? They were singing brilliantly as ever but afraid we saw too little to make much more comment.

We are now waiting for a response from the help desk (we know other people have also had this issue). Sorry for the lack of commentary in the mean time!

**We're back!** No response from the helpdesk but as many others were having the same issue (i.e. Discord, ESCUnited) it seems like they've stopped that restriction. No more stream refreshing I guess! We caught the end of Latvia, which is basically what was on the clip. **Sadly that means no Switzerland, Czechia, France, Armenia, Austria, Denmark, Armenia and Latvia** in this coverage, but we'll cover them tonight. We go straight from Latvia to...

**Finalist B: Spain**

**Postcard:** I missed the oldschool song due to the excitement of reviving the stream, but of course 2022 is the more recent one. A brief technical delay after the postcard and then we're in...

**Performance:** Mery and her dancers start off inside the cube. The press in the arena love it and are singing along, of course. One of the dancers (not the ginger one!) had trouble with his costume change and they had to pause their choreography whilst he tried to get rid of the stray trouser leg. Mery is vocally how she always is - just about on tune but flanked by a lot of supporting prerecorded vocals. The camerawork feels quite messy to me, although there's a cool top-down shot near the end. The final chorus has some light pyro.

**Song 10: San Marino**

**Postcard:** No ad break or skit before or after Spain, interestingly. The featured songs are 2014 and 2019 - how dare they erase 2021 like this!

**Performance:** Sounds to me like Kenzy is saving vocally here, she's basically just talking the chorus. The staging is so colourful and fun, there's some really cool camera angles and use of the cartoonish visuals, and there's also a slight revamp to the instrumental break and final chorus, and loads of pyro at the end! San Marino aren't here to play - if you liked the snippet, you will love the full performance. A couple of untidy camera angles but nothing they can't tweak.

**Song 11: Georgia**

**Postcard:** 2015 and my favourite ESC song of all time 2007 are the featured songs! (CaptainAna is also very excited by these choices)

**Performance:** Starts off very atmospherically with the stage very red and Nutsa on her pedestal. If you have 'projections of artist on the backdrop' on your bingo card then this is the performance for you. It seems from the backdrop also that the fire Nutsa is attempting to put out is in fact the sun. Nutsa's perfect, powerful vocals rise above a layer of support prerecorded backing vocals. Really polished - if Georgia fail to qualify again this year, they certainly can't blame Nutsa and the staging.

**Song 12: Belgium**

**Postcard:** Belgium's winner, 1986, and 2015 are shown. As my flair indicates, this is one of my favourites this year so I am very nervous!

**Performance:** The performance starts out with intimate camerawork focussed on Mustii in the dark - he's then illuminated and steps forwards towards the halo of mics. A slight change of costume - his hands look a lot more gold to me than before, and the shirt is different too. The camerawork is working for me, although I still think they could have done more given how good the video is. The chorus has a very isolated bit of dry ice which seems to just be on his platform and kinda masks him. Vocally he's about the same as he has been so far in rehearsals, a bit pitchy generally sadly, especially in the falsetto of the chorus. He's more on tune in the 'before the party is over' to me, although the stream was deciding to lag for the first time since we got back online. I still think this song is strong enough to make it, but he's not done enough here to persuade his doubters yet.

**Song 13: Estonia**

**Postcard:** 2001 and 2009 are shown.

**Performance:** Afraid as much as I love this song I've not learned all the guys names, sorry! #shoddyjournalism. Anyway, it starts off with the first dude off stage making his way to the stage. He's shouting the vocals more than singing and is pretty out of tune, although the nature of the verse means it doesn't matter too much. These shouty vocals continue all out from most of the guys sadly. The lads are having fun, but I really think this feels both empty and messy, kinda like Albania earlier. The guys doing the veisson are projected onto the background at one point too, but I just want a stable camera angle to focus on the dance and its brilliance instead of darting around all over the place. We love this song, but will the casuals?

**Qualifier C: Italy**

**Postcard:** Again, straight into Italy without an ad break here. 2021 got featured, unfortunately I missed the first one due to typing up my thoughts on Estonia.

**Performance:** And the stream freezing is back in full force - maybe other press are all focussing in for one of the favourites! Angelina is back in the costume for the first rehearsals. Not convinced it works still as it blends her and her dancers into the already too dark stage. The stream was dead for the entire first half of the song, but we came back to Angelina owning the camera on her thrown flanked by her dancers. Angelina is brilliant as we all know but she could do with some better camera angles - she and her dancers get lost in the wide shots.

**Song 14: Israel**

**Postcard:** Still no ad break, are we having an ad-free show?? 1991 and 1998 are the songs of choice.

**Performance:** Eden starts off in her circle seemingly alone before the dry ice clears and her dancers appear on the edges. It looks like they've toned down some of the more aggressive 'dance moves', though their general movements feel way too much to me still - kinda like Georgia 2010 where the vocalist is impressive but the choreography is distracting more than complimenting. Eden is vocally flawless including the scream notes. The song ends with an orange light on the back fading. An effective performance on the whole.

**A brief break, finally!** With Petra reminding us how to vote. But only for ten seconds or so, maybe they need extra time to remove the prop.

**Song 15: Norway**

**Postcard:** 1986 and 2009 are the songs of choice. The band are skiing and playing cards, not at the same time.

**Performance:** After a brief technical delay, we're off! The blue laser lights from the ceiling look really effective here and the stage floor graphics are very clever and atsmospheric. I can't help but feel like it's lost some of the edge and magic it had in MGP though where the pre-recorded film inserts really added. The camerawork, although again it could still be fixed, is still relying too much on wide shots and panning angles when I just want to be intimately in the moment with the band.

**Song 16: Netherlands**

**Postcard:** 1998 (robbed!) and 2019 are the choices.

**Performance:** Well, as you'd expect from Joost the stage visuals are a feast of gags, including a stretched version of Joost's face, the polygonal Joost running in the background, the 'this graphic is unfinished' and a couple of other gems. The bird is still there, the melodic 'Euro-pa-pa-pa-papa-pa-pa' bit is all prerecorded backings, and he's still allowed the subtitles for the final speech in the sad bit. No tears from Joost this time, but it's still an effective ending and the camera lingers on that poignant final note. It's good fun, but it is obviously nowhere near the ridiculously high level of heights his hype team built up and if you expect anything more than a fun, light-hearted performance you will be disappointed. For all the theories, there *is no big surprise.*

**17:21CEST:** Petra and Malin arrive and open the voting!

**Recap 1:** The snippets are all the same basically as what we've already seen, so unfortunately I can't glean much from the songs we didn't see. Kaleen freestyles a bit in addressing the audience but is vocally shaky. The sad outro is the Dutch choice of clips.

**Interval: Sing Along.** Malin and Petra introduce that Swedes love a good sing-along, and then try to get the audience singing along with the start of Greece 2005, which works about as predictably poorly as you'd expect with a largely empty auditorium. Then **Helena Paparizou** shows up to take over and is vocally immaculate - she's certainly not lost her talent with age! So good in fact that she made the stream die, hooray! Fortunately it's just come back and there's lots of images of fans singing along on the screen.

Then it's **Charlotte Perrelli Nilsson's turn,** another lady who can still belt our her winner! This interval probably fun for the audience but the lack of any exciting staging or graphics makes it all feel a bit dull to me. Finally, **Sertab Erener appears**, a little vocally off but it's still great to have Turkey back on the stage, albeit just through Sertab's guest performance. The three ladies reunite at the end to bow and thank the audience.

**Recap 2:** More minor observations: Kaleen is in her second rehearsal outfit, the silvery one. Armenia stands out to me in the recap. Kenzy's vocals are noticably out on the recap but like I said it sounded like she was saving generally. Georgia has chosen the ending. Norway of course uses the immense leaning back moment and looks immense.

**Voting closes!** Malin flubs and stumbles over her teleprompter lines, hopefully she'll be a bit more comfortable with the script tomorrow because it feels like she's not even read it before now!

**17:50CEST:** We then get a retrospective video like the ones from yesterday, this time focussed on songs which 'almost' got to Eurovision, mainly focussed on Sweden to start with, before we learn about Lys Assia's failed attempt to return for Switzerland in 2012 and a couple of German fun facts. Ralph Siegal gets a shoutout with a montage of some of his (many) songs which never made it to Eurovision. Our ears were indeed blessed to avoid them!

**17:43CEST:** Next is the montage of turquoise carpet looks again like we got for the first semi. Followed by a delay which almost certainly won't be there in the live shows.

**17:45CEST:** Petra's song 'We Just Love Eurovision Too Much' is next, which is... well, it's nowhere near as good as 'Love Love, Peace Peace' and will probably rub the people who were unhappy with Sweden's win up the wrong way, among other things. Lyrically it is very on the nose in its humour, with jokes about juries voting for Sweden, Eurovision being non-political and more. Charlotte Perrelli Nilsson appears again helping out in the vocals, as does Lynda Woodruff. They were just mentioning Kaarija and the Moomins appeared and then the stream has died, so who knows what happens next! The stream returned for the end, which is a big showgirls style finale. EDIT: Our Discord friends have informed us that Kaarija appears as part of the Finnish section here.

**Qualifiers Announcement:** Through a choppy stream, we watch the following songs 'qualify': Albania, Malta, Armenia, Switzerland, Belgium, Czechia, Latvia, San Marino, Netherlands and finally Greece! Of course these are completely random so don't read too much into them!

They seemed to drag out the qualifiers section more than on Tuesday to me, perhaps because the intervals are shorter.

Well, that was a weird old time. Thanks for joining us, and we'll be back this evening at 21:00CEST with coverage of the **jury rehearsal**, hopefully this time with less technical hiccups!

Except... it's not actually over as for some reason **Herreys** (Sweden 1984) are here to sing us out for the outro. Feels like a strange decision given we can still see the artists in the green/pink room behind the stage reacting to their qualification!",1715174112.0,2024-05-08T23:15:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1cn4abd/live_commentary_semifinal_2_dress_rehearsal_1/
Ranking the Top 52 Eurovision Countries since 1975: Getting to the OG's (#15-#11),1cln2p6,3,"Happy ESC week! We are SO close to finding out the best ESC nations of all time. This edition will be the last before the top 10!! We are really in the heart of the countdown, so without further delay, here’s #15-#11!

# The Countries

|Placement|Country|Score|
|:-|:-|:-|
|11|Germany|177318.767|
|12|Denmark|170388.676|
|13|Switzerland|160782.533|
|14|Netherlands|156379.576|
|15|Belgium|155913.214|

We are now getting to the original 7 countries to participate in Eurovision! First of the bunch is Belgium, who was the last of the original countries to win their first contest, all the way back in 1986! Of course they have delivered some classics, and they also have one of the peculiar records in this competition! Above them is another OG in the Netherlands, who used to dominate this contest in its early years alongside France, but like France faced a 40+ year drought since their last victory. Of course, unlike France, they actually have broken that streak with one of the most popular ESC songs in history, the one that really started this contest and pushed it into the mainstream! Above them is Switzerland, the country that started it all, the country that won the very first edition, and the country who has one of the most famous wins in this contest’s history! Not bad considering they have only two victories to their name! At #12 is Denmark, the only non original 7 members on this list, but probably have some of the most underrated victories in this contest’s history! And if not for some underachieving in the last decade, they could easily be a part of this top 10! Speaking of, just outside the top 10 is Germany, the second to last original 7 members to claim their ESC crown, and who have two main people to thank for their victories! Of course they are a laughing stock now, but when they have their act together, they have produced some wonderful moments across multiple generations of this competition.

Some Notable Acts: Blanche (Belgium), Chanée (Denmark), Annie Cotton (Switzerland), Mélanie Cohl (Belgium), Céline Dion (Switzerland), Edsilia (Netherlands), Emmelie de Forest (Denmark), Luca Hänni (Switzerland),  Gjon's Tears (Switzerland), Sandra Kim (Belgium), Duncan Laurence (Netherlands), Lena (Germany), N'evergreen (Denmark), Nicole (Germany), Loïc Nottet (Belgium), OG3NE (Netherlands), Olsen Brothers (Denmark), Rasmussen (Denmark), Rollo and King (Denmark), Michael Schulte (Germany), Daniela Simons (Switzerland), Sürpriz (Germany), Teach-In (Netherlands), The Common Linnets (Netherlands), Urban Trad (Belgium), Wind (Germany),

# The Worst Years

# Germany | 2015 | [Ann Sophie - Black Smoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGMJOchTRPc)

***Contest Ranking***: 27th (0 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 40th (last, -3.9)

Germany’s success since 2010 has been… not great, to put it lightly. Four last place entries, with a combined 35 points between them, including a 0 point performance here. Think about like this, Germany before 2010 only had 5 last place finishes in total\*\*, so safe to say they really just… stopped trying? I don’t even know if I can say that, because they have sent in some good songs in this time frame, but there seems to be a disconnect between them and the audience/juries. This song isn’t even that bad, a bit bland, but does that deserve 0 points?? Idk. In fact, I don’t know what’s going on with this country.

\*\* In the Grand Final

# Switzerland | 2004 | [Piero and the MusicStars - Celebrate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUX3_0KM7fc)

***Contest Ranking***: DNQ (22nd Semi Final, 0 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 36th (last, -3.3)

There are some times where Switzerland sends in some absolute bangers, as we will talk about with their best entry. Then there’s this era for the Red Cross country. Ever since their 3rd place finish in 1993, ending their very successful 20 year period, it's been… ROUGH\*\*. You know how bad it’s been? Switzerland has a zero point entry in the Grand Final ([1998 entry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tyh39VaRcV0)), and they have a zero point entry in the Semifinals (this one). I genuinely have no idea how this won their national final. Yes, you saw that right, this song won a NATIONAL FINAL, it was not selected internally! This is some crap you would see a kid’s birthday party, not at the biggest song contest in the world. The 2000’s were a dark time man….

\*\* You wanna know something else? Switzerland would only finish in the top 10 ONCE between 1994 and 2018(!) They would only make the grand finals 5 times from this entry (2004) to 2020(!!).

# Belgium | 2009 | [Copycat - Copycat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkLQ1_xC5yQ)

***Contest Ranking***: DNQ (17th 1st Semi Final, 1 pt)  
***My Ranking***: 41st (last, -0.282)

Belgium has won a contest with a 13 year old, have nearly won a contest with a song in an imaginary language, and are owners of one of the [original troll entries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zB6f3yIgwk). But this… man it seems like Belgium tries to find new and exciting ways to be weird, and you have to commend them for it, but this… why Elvis??

# Denmark | 2023 | Reiley - Breaking My Heart

***Contest Ranking***: DNQ (14th 2nd Semi Final, 6 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 34th (0.496)

Denmark haven’t tried all that much since their win in 2013, which seems harsh, but man it sure seems like it. This is their lowest point total since 1982(!!), and well I can kinda see why. It’s go generic man, and what’s with the vocoder?? Sorry if it feels like I’m being more negative here, but man these songs do not do good things to my eardrums.

# Netherlands | 2023 | [Mia Nicolai and Dion Cooper - Burning Daylight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOf-oKDlO6A)

***Contest Ranking***: DNQ (13th 1st Semi Final, 7 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 33rd (0.789)

Another 2023 entry on the worst list! And I see why, it’s only the first time the Netherlands have failed to score double digits this millennium, and it’s with a song co-written by the artist that won it all for them just 4 years earlier. I’ve heard some of the issues that plagued this entry, but I don’t care enough to look into them right now. Dang I wonder what other countries achieved their worst performance in the last 5 years?

# The Best Years

# Switzerland | 2021 | [Gjon's Tears - Tout l'univers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpM6o6UiBIw)

***Contest Ranking***: *3rd* (432 pts)  
***My Ranking***: *4th* (469.287\*\*)

You would think with all the negativity I placed on these countries' more recent entries, the top songs would be from circa 1990, but that couldn’t be further from the truth! These countries, especially Switzerland, have proved that they *can* compete in the 21st century, and this is a shining example! Switzerland, for all of the hoopla of hosting and winning the first competition, haven’t done much in the 60ish years since, when compared to their other contemporaries. Of course they have probably one of the most famous victories of all time, with young Celine Dion squeaking gold in Dublin in ‘88 ([avert your eyes UK fans](https://youtu.be/BVteog9vFcc?si=f8CmgzSX1zqOR02S&t=270)). Since then, well, let me put it like this. Since 2004, when the semifinal format was introduced, Switzerlands have only qualified 7 times, and have only made the top 10 3 times in that period. Luckily, two of those entries were in the top 5, and one of those entries was this one! Gjon’s Tears, or Gjon Muharremaj, is another COVID participant who got his start on the show Albanians Got Talent. Gjon got his stage name at the age of 12, when he performed a beautiful rendition of Elvis’ song, “Can’t Help Falling In Love”, which moved his grandfather to tears. In 2019, he was in the singing competition  The Voice: la plus belle voix, where he was on Team Mika (yes, that Mika). He was selected by the national broadcaster to compete in ESC 2020, but I don’t have to explain what happened. He got another chance in 2021, with a new song called “Tout l’univers”.

Eurovision 2021 was a stacked contest that year, wasn’t it? With all of the returning artists combined with some of the best talent at the time, it was really a show for the ages. The top 3 that year would have all deserved to win that year, and they were all non-english entries! This French song talks about  yearning and longing to be reunited with a loved one, which is shown through its passionate live performance. Gjon himself is an excellent singer, with those high notes at the end of the song being a highlight! I say this a lot (and I just said it now), but in another year this would have won, I mean it placed first in its semifinal for crying out loud! The only two songs that placed above it were from the Big 5 (France and Italy), so really of all the songs that had to qualify, this one was the best. You know what’s funny? This entry marks 33 years since Celine Dion won, who herself won 32 years after Lys Assia took home the prize for Switzerland in 1956. It literally would have been near perfect if Switzerland had won. Oh well, guess we’ll have to wait until around 2053 for Switzerland to win their third title…

\*\* This song is one of the ***Top 50*** ESC entries since 1975.  
\*\*\* I think Switzerland is tied with Spain for having the lowest margin of victory for a multiple time winner (1 point, maybe Spain should take the title since we don’t know the full results of 1956)

# Belgium | 2017 | [Blanche - City Lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbomdE81_mA)

***Contest Ranking***: 4th (363 pts)  
***My Ranking***: *3rd* (477.742\*\*)

Of all of the black aesthetic entries that Belgium tried, this was the one that did the best! I’m a tad bit surprised that this song was on top, but I feel that it is pretty representative of how well Belgium did in the mid 2010’s, with 2 top four finishes (3 top 10 placements overall). Meet Ellie Noa Blanche Delvaux, known mostly by her third name Blanche, who got her start through Belgium’s The Voice, singing a song by a well known dark aesthetic artist, [Adele](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vE5fChAOWA). She would eventually be called by RTBF (one of the Belgian broadcasters) to perform at ESC in Lisbon, with her song “City Lights”.

Boy does Belgium like them young! Their top three entries according to my formula are of course Blanche (17 at the time), Loïc Nottet (21 at the time), and most famously Sandra Kim (13 at the time). It seems like their young talent really does carry them at this competition, and it shows with this song. This song is very emotional, so much so that you can see the emotion on Blanche’s face at the final (go watch it if you can). There’s actually not much else I have to say for this song, it’s very solid and it was one of the highlights in a year where emotions would reign supreme (I realize that could be applied to a lot of years, but this one in particular). Like I said before, this entry was one of several in the Belgian black aesthetic wave, which honestly worked out for them more often than not. If not for this success in the 2010’s, I would be talking about Sandra Kim and how Belgium really peaked in 2003.

\*\* This song is one of the ***Top 50*** ESC entries since 1975.

# Germany | 2010 | [Lena - Satellite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pL9vdpSvnY)

***Contest Ranking***: ***1st*** (246 pts)  
***My Ranking***: ***1st*** (492.531\*\*)

This entry was a result of Germany wanting to host Eurovision 2011, that’s all. Germany in ESC is the ultimate form of consistency, only missing 1 contest in its 60+ year history. But they don’t have much to show for it, in terms of victories anyway, they have contributed to ESC in [different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keq4eze8eTo) [ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maFlRR-zt4g). But when Nicole stummed her way into Europe’s heart in 1982, it was the culmination of several years of the work of Ralph SIgel, who composed many of the hits that had Germany in the Top 10, and eventually, in the winner’s circle. Germany (at least West Germany) was finally a winner! But after some solid entries in the following years, the country’s performance started to falter. ***That*** culminated in not only a last place finish, but also their only non qualification in their history. It was a bit dark for Germany, then came “Alf Igel”, really known as Stefan Raab, an entertainer, producer, and TV host, who shook up the formula that was slowly growing old for Germany. He delivered some top 10 placements as a writer and performer (you should look at 1998, 2000 and 2004 for those), but his magnum opus has to be 2010, when he initiated a national selection show for Germany to pick a song for ESC 2010, for the purposes of wanting to host Eurovision 2011. From that show came “Satellite” , sung by Lena Johanna Therese Meyer-Landrut, known simply as Lena.

This song is simple, it’s a song about love. The live performance was simple as well, with Lena in a simple black dress with four backing singers behind her. There’s nothing flashy about this performance, which is why I think it won. Coming off of the most extravagant Eurovision in the modern era, Oslo really scaled back the production for this one (it also might have been influenced by the recession at the time, but I digress). A LOT of people think that Turkey should have won this year, just look at the comments under the video, but I think that Lena deserved this one. If you look at the voting sequence, there’s a point where the hosts interview Manga, and the band said that they expected to be top 3, but I saw that as they were expecting to be winning at this point. Manga said that they crafted the perfect song for ESC, but Germany were doing the same, and Stefan Raab, despite the wacky exterior, knows what he is doing. He was the judge that selected Lena for this contest, probably because he saw someone who knows what they are doing, and Lena ***knows*** what she is doing. She takes a basic song about love and maxes out its potential, with her perfectly placing enough energy throughout the duration to capture the hearts of all of Europe. I think I’ll quote Cookie Fonster’s review of Eurovision 2010 to show you what I mean. “As a song, this can be summed up in two words: fresh and infectious.” This song just fills you up with happy energy, and at a time where people are down due to the widespread global recession, this song and performance works perfectly. It’s German efficiency at its finest, and it got them their first and only win since reunification . It’s just tragic that as more and more time passes, this entry seems like an outlier for Germany, as this success would be fleeting at best for the country in the years to follow. \*\* This song is one of the ***Top 50*** ESC entries since 1975.

# Netherlands | 2019  | [Duncan Laurence - Arcade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eztx7Wr8PtE)

***Contest Ranking***: ***1st*** (498 pts)  
***My Ranking***: *2nd* (522.93\*\*)

The one that broke the drought, and the one that started the mainstream wave of ESC! The Netherlands were one of the early giants of Eurovision, but after Teach-In brought the country their fourth crown, tied for the most at the time, it would be a ***long*** time before they would sniff the mountaintop again. It’s not like there were close calls, they finished top 5 several times, and in 1998 they placed 4th, but it wouldn’t be until [2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWe8PRsW4T0)\*\*\*  that they would break into the top three, their first time since Teach-In. One of the members of that entry, Isle DeLange, would be a future coach for The Voice of Holland, and guess who would be one of the singers that she would coach? That’s right, it would be Duncan de Moor, more famously known as Duncan Laurance. Duncan started writing songs as an escape from being bullied, and he would eventually start playing in a couple of bands, including forming his own. He would then go on to be selected to perform at Eurovision in Tel Aviv, by none other than Isle DeLange! (It’s all connected, isn’t it?)

The song, called “Arcade”, details “the emotional journey of someone who is deeply in love but also grappling with the pain of a past relationship”, and boy do you feel that journey throughout the song. At ESC, all you see with Duncan’s performance is him, a piano, and a ball of light, I think. It makes you focus on him and the song, and that only adds to its benefits. Say what you want about the clunky metaphor of an “Arcade” (more of a Casino), but through it all this song’s main goal is to make you *feel*, and it does that in spades. This entry really could be the theme song of the Netherlands’ ESC journey since 1975, which makes it all the more appropriate that it was the one to break the country’s ***45*** year drought (At the time, only Spain had a longer drought for a country that still competed). When this song won, who knew the impact it would have in the few years since! In 2020, when the world was shut down due to COVID, this song took off through Tik Tok, which vaulted Duncan into international superstardom. This entry really did mark the start of the viral era of Euroviosn, with more songs in the coming years taking a similar path. As of now, it is the most streamed song in ESC history, and I don’t think it will be passed anytime soon. The Netherlands, who were known for being the rulers of early ESC, now are responsible for birthing the contest into a new age (mind the pun). Who knew that it was all set up with a country/folk group in 2014?  
And don’t worry, I *will* talk about the entry that finished 1st for me this year. This year’s stats showcase an… *interesting* trend in the post 2016 ESC landscape.

\*\* This song is one of the ***Top 50*** ESC entries since 1975.  
\*\*\* One of the most underrated songs in ESC history, if you ask me. If Austria didn’t send in Conchita, this one would have won for sure! This entry is ranked ***51st*** of all ESC songs since 1975, which unfortunately seems fitting for how this song is remembered.

# Denmark | 2013 | [Emmelie de Forest - Only Teardrops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k59E7T0H-Us)

***Contest Ranking***: ***1st*** (281 pts)  
***My Ranking***: ***1st*** (624.715\*\*)

In 2000, the Olsen Brothers competed and won for Denmark in Sweden (ranked 55th overall). Thirteen years later Emmelie de Forest would compete and win for Denmark in Sweden! Ever since Eurovision 2001, Denmark has been up and down in this contest. They actually were top 5 in 2010 and 2011, only to be 23rd in 2012. But in 2013, when Sweden hosted the contest for the 4th time, it would be this young artist that would claim Denmark's 3rd win at Eurovision.

Emmelie de Forest (not of English Royalty I’m afraid) had a rocky childhood, with her parents divorcing when she was young. She grew up in Denmark and in Sweden, performing at small festivals when she was a teenager. She won the chance to compete at ESC through Denmark’s national selection show, and as the odds on favorite, she would win and cement herself into ESC lore… kinda. See, I said at the top that this entry is one of the most underrated victories at ESC, especially in the last decade or so. It is seen as just radio pop, which no one has a problem with, considering the [alternative option](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN3d_V7KVLE)that year, but it kinda just… exists, which is a shame. Denmark’s winning songs have a common thread between them (besides having a prominent instrument in the song), which is that they are really nice to listen to. [“Dansevise”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYyhJvRE3mQ)is one of the few 60’s ESC songs that I enjoy, as the atmosphere of the song really lulls you in. [“Fly On The WIngs Of Love”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-JwiYlg5Gc) (ranked 55th of all songs since 1975) is just a nice song, even if it is more guitar pop  “Only Teardrops” feels like a mix of the two, with the atmosphere of “Dansevise” combined with the poppy aspect of “Fly On The WIngs Of Love”, creating an instant classic in my eyes. I wish this song got more recognition, because even though I would have it 3rd of the three Denmark winners, it is like its more famous contemporaries, which is that it’s a really nice song.

\*\* This song is one of the ***Top 50*** ESC entries since 1975.

# Final Thoughts

What do you think? Which song here is your favorite? Do you think the top entries here are underrated? Overrated? Which of these countries is most likely to win again?

🎙️ [Live Commentary] Semi-final 1: Dress Rehearsal 1 @ 14:45 CEST,1clivqy,208,"**Welcome to our first dress rehearsal press coverage of the year!**

# How will this coverage work?

In this afternoon's thread, we will be trialling running our commentary a new way. I will be updating this thread after each performance with my rough thoughts on each rehearsal, with some additional thoughts and comments from some of the other mods too. **Please keep refreshing this thread - new updates will be added to the bottom of the OP roughly every five minutes!**

For this evening's jury show/dress rehearsal 2/evening preview, we will be covering the rehearsal **via** [**Reddit Live**](https://www.reddit.com/live/1ayffk1w0rlw9/) **like we did last year**. This will allow you to read a variety of voices and thoughts on the performances.

\_\_\_

**15:45CEST:** We are off! The show begins with a montage of all the artists of this year in postcard style, very wholesome!

**15:49CEST:** Eleni Foureira kicks off the show, emerging from the middle cube. She's pretty scantily clad and her dance routine includes a bit of handkerchief choreography a bit like Marina Satti this year! There's either fake applause/cheers going on for this first rehearsal or the associated press in the arena are very loud!

**15:51CEST:** Eric Saade is next, with a rearranged version of his 2011 song 'Popular', complete with a very playful nod to the glass-breaking moment from his original performance.#

**15:53CEST:** Chanel is next, dressed in a blue costume which reminds me of Albina's (Croatia 2021), with ample booty of course. The backdrop is also blue, and there's pyro for both her an Eleni.

**15:55CEST:** Our hosts have arrived! Malin is in a pink suit, Petra in orange. About Malmo hosting, Petra says: 'Don't blame me, even I voted for Finland!' They've redone their lines after a bit of improv which reminds us that this is very much the first dress rehearsal. The cheers *do* appear to be live as whole pockets of the audience have been made up of the press - shoutouts to the press people there in person for being very loud and enthusiastic!#

**Song 1: Cyprus**

**Postcard:** The postcard starts with a purple graphic of the world tracing from Malmo to the country in question, in this case Cyprus. There's then a clip from a couple of previous Cypriot entries (1997 and 2012 I believe), and then shots of Silia. It feels quite different but I quite like it!

**Performance:** This performance really makes the stage feel massive with the use of cyan flooding lights and some effective use of blue flashing lights. Silia is slightly flat throughout and sounds a little nervous in her vocals. Otherwise it's the same energetic open you'd expect. They turned the lights out on her a little too quickly at the end, will probably fix that for the live show!

**Song 2: Serbia**

**Postcard:** The songs featured are 2007 and 2022 (Bitti Zdrava!) We see Teya playing her piano in an old building. I quite like the nod to past entrants, but others have mentioned that it provides a comparison to 'greatest' hits which can be unhelpful for current artists. They do also look a bit cheaper than some other users.

**Performance:** Teya starts off sat down on her rock with some intimate camerawork, being ever so slightly oxymated by the dry ice. She also sounds ever so slightly off to me in the verses, though she's absolutely fine belting it out in the chorus. I must say that I'm not getting fully sucked into the performance here although admittedly I've never really connected with the song - the giant watermarks we get on the digital feed also impacts ability to engage with the performance. There is a very effective final shot though with a lila ramonda which they've kept hidden from the gallery pics! We also see the artists leave the stage at the end, which seems like an intentional new directorial choice.

**Song 3: Lithuania**

**Postcard:** The featured songs are 2012 and 2021 (no 2006? Shame!).

**Performance:** This is the same polished, hypnotic performance from the national final, with a couple of new cool graphical moments. Silvester sounds great too! Camerawork wise there's still too many wide shots (and the video compression is not enjoying all the flashing lights!) but the sound balancing has been pretty excellent so far to my ears.

**Song 4: Ireland**

**Postcard:** There's one of Johnny Logan's songs, afraid I missed which one in between messages and catching up typing things! The shots of Bambie are very artistic as you'd expect!

**Performance:** Bambie starts off with a witchly cackle before the soundtrack has even began (accompanied by a massive cheer from the press). Camerawork is very tight and there's lots of clever shots and imagery which we didn't even have revealed in the gallery - a great shot with a satanic star and with the moon in the background. Bambie is emoting fantastically, and yes *there is a costume change!* This is three minutes of unforgettable artistry, ending in Bambie's effective high kick from the NF and a massive 'crown the witch' graphic on the backdrop. This is brilliant (and the other mods watching agree). Effing said: 'Wow, Bambie went crazier than Hatari!'

**Break:** Malin mentions that Bambie is the first non-binary artist - it's kinda weird hearing such an American accent in the main production! Petra then claims to know every single Eurovision song off by heart in a skit where she proves that is not the case. Then the ad break ends and Petra introduces Olly with quite a quick 'Remember, you can't vote for this!'

**Finalist A: United Kingdom**

**Postcard:** 1967 and 2022 get shown. Olly is having fun somewhere outside.

**Performance:** Stream quality took a nosedive at the start so we missed the very beginning. There is lots of very clever 'gravity' choreography, tight dance moves, upside down camerawork and a lot of homoerotic dancemoves. If you found the rehearsal clip too much, you will probably find other parts of it too much although I still think it that clip is the most risque bit. They have stopped the weird facial expressions and open mouths now which helps. The new final chorus is completely revamped and so much better than the original track, with Olly and the dancers finally emerging from their locker room. This enable Olly to go for a vocal big moment which he was slightly off on but otherwise fine. Even then, the camerawork is fantastic, as are the lights and pyro. This is an unforgettable performance and they have elevated this song immensely from the studio. I'm a proud Brit right now!

**Song 5: Ukraine:**

**Postcard:** The featured songs were Wild Dances and another one (EDIT: It was Shum, thanks Effing!), afraid I was too busy recovering from Olly and collating my thoughts to notice much else. Interestingly they go straight from the UK into this without announcement.

**Performance:** Jerry is a little bit vocally weak here and sounds a bit nervy. The graphics are very pretty, with some cool silhouettes on the cubes. There's a couple of other awesome graphical moments, especially the final shot where they lie down on top of a graphic of other women, and a holographic Jerry moment. It's effective but I'd hazard to say not quite as brilliant as a whole as it felt like it might be from the clips seen so far (unsure if the other mods agree!)

**Song 6: Poland**

**Postcard:** 1994 and 2014 are the songs of choice.

**Performance:** This also seems to have gotten a slight musical revamp, with some added melody in the verses and also live backing vocalists providing harmonies which are slightly too loud in the mix. Vocally this is easily the best I've heard from Luna live, although she's still a bit breathy generally. As for what's going on stage, well, it's certainly distinctive. I don't think it's overly distracting in a negative way, but it also doesn't necessarily work either. The moments on the horse are good, but I'm not sure why we need the camera to stick on random chess piece people flailing limbs for so long. The ending seems pretty effective and Luna seems to be enjoying her movement.

**Song 7: Croatia**

Unfortunately the stream died in a major way at the end of Poland and didn't come back until towards the end of Croatia, and even then was buffering and skipping all over the place. So sadly we can't give any particularly meaningful commentary of this staging until tonight's dress rehearsal. It looked and sounded great from what little we did see though - I particularly love Marko's intonation which he's perfected.

**Song 8: Iceland**

**Postcard:** Again missed the postcard due to catching up on post writing! One of the songs was 1986 I believe, but I didn't catch the second one.

**Performance:** A bit more buffering but the stream seems to have largely recovered. There's some nice lasers and background lights and Hera is owning the stage, but to me she sounds ever so slightly sharp? There's also just not enough going on on stage really to make this engaging, especially after a heavy hitter like Croatia, and her backing singers are shrouded in darkness for some reason. The ending is slightly different with a long note which was ever so slightly off to me.

**Ad Break:** There's a little bit where they put Eurovision songs over (presumably famous, sorry for being uncultured) movie scenes, tying into Malin's acting experience. There's a shoutout to the many people involved in the technical side of the performance. Clearly the German staging needs a bit of a break as they're still setting it up behind Petra.

**Finalist B: Germany**

**Postcard:** Features 1993 (I believe, may have been 1994) and 2010, and Isaak being wholesome with a dog.

**Performance:** The opening is different to the studio track as he's performed in the preparties. Starts with a slow zoom on Isaak on his seat next to a big fire. Isaak is vocally brilliant and is including lots of extra vocal flourishes, but he's not really hitting any of the cameras and it all feels a bit too much like going through the motions to me. The camerawork is basically lots of slow panning shots around the flaming room. It's nice to see the backing singers appear at the end to do the run na na ay bits, and there's a nice bit with the lights shutting off at the end, but the overall product feels sadly lifeless to me.

**Song 9: Slovenia**

**Postcard:** Features 2001 and 2019, underrated gems!

**Performance:** Starts out very dark with Raiven lying down among some dry ice, but we get to everything being blue and bright rather quickly. The dancers are doing the same thing as in the music video. Camerawork really could do with being a bit more tight, the wide shots don't work for the atmosphere of the song. The ending shot is quite effective too. I don't think this is a write-off by any means but it's not as atmospheric as it could be.

**Song 10: Finland**

**Postcard:** Missed the first song due to buffering, but unsurprisingly Kaarija is the other choice!

**Performance:** Sounded a bit like Teemu was forgetting his words at the start with how he slurred them compared to normal. We do indeed see his ass in at least one camerashot, and there's a couple of moments where we can clearly see his flesh-coloured thong where the dancing/camerawork could do with being a bit tighter. Otherwise it's much the same in terms of visual gags as at UMK. The press in the arena are loving it, of course. The backdrop is surprisingly static and unexciting, as is the lightshow. 'Yeah, this is Finland!' he says at the end.

**Song 11: Moldova**

**Postcard:** 2005 and 2010 are shown, although every briefly! We see Natalia getting ready at a studio as well as boxing and going on a picnic with a giant teddy bear.

**Performance:** This has probably the most colourful and pretty graphics of every performance so far, including a really pretty shot from above with fish swimming around her. Sometimes the graphics and colours are a bit distracting, such as the giant butterflies on the cubes. She's singing well and adding in some extra vocal flourishes, but it really is a very static performance and lacks a clear 'vote me' moment. It was better than I thought it might be from the clips before, but as another mod said, it's lacking that Moldovan magic.

**Qualifier C: Sweden**

**Postcard:** No ad break, just a little introduction before Sweden. 1983 and of course 2023 are shown.

**Performance:** This starts off identically to at Melfest, with the LED walls either side of them and the same choreography and the boys' playful energy. It looks and sounds great. The difference is the end of the song, with the walls pushed right to the edge of the stage. The digital colours and flashing graphics here are immense and this will be a very strong way to start the final on Saturday.

**Song 12: Azerbaijan**

**Postcard:** They have a cat! The featured songs are 2009 and 2011.

**Performance:** Very effective opening here with the use of white and black light and a silhouette emerging from beneath the sea behind Fahree. The backdrop is really cool, as is the use of hands on the floor graphics. Unfortunately he's ever so slightly flat to start and on the very last note, and the camerawork goes full on wide shot city in the chorus which makes it feel a bit flat. You can also clearly see a stagehand rolling the giant hand prop onto stage behind Ilkin (who is perfect vocally). I'm unsure about this - some bits work really well, others feel a bit lifeless.

**Song 13: Australia**

**Postcard:** 2015 and 2019 are the songs of choice - poor Dami Im!

**Performance:** The lights give a kind of rainbow northern lights effects on Zaachariaha's dress, starting with some intimate camerawork which is quite good. It is pretty clearly low budget but they are making the absolute most of the resources they have - their own charisma and well controlled camerawork. There's lots of interactions between Zaachariaha and Michael, and a clever fade into the backing singers arriving. Zaachariaha started singing slightly behind the tune near the end which made it feel a bit messy, which is also how the entrance of the digeridoo bloke feels. Lots of vocal acrobatics too which aren't always convincing.

**Song 14: Portugal**

**Postcard:** Missed the first song due to buffering, but obviously 2017 is the second one.

**Performance:** Lots of stream issues at the start of this one I'm afraid so difficult to get a feel for atmosphere. However, the first shot is really effective in a trimmed narrow aspect ratio which frames Iolanda's expressions. As is the use of white colour throughout which is consistently interesting and adds to the send of intensity that the music gives. Iolanda is vocally flawless, probably the best vocal performance of the day to me. Altogether a very effective performance!

**Song 15: Luxembourg**

**Postcard:** 1965 and 1988 I think were shown but again I may be wrong, sorry! Tali is having fun with some friends in a park, and has her now-signature plats too.

**Performance:** The performance starts out drenched in a kind of pinky-red light as Tali is surrounded by a pink box with other boxes and her dancers around her. Pyro from the first chorus and some clever flashing lights for the revamped end of the chorus. Tali sounds a lot more in control of her breathing to my untrained ear, and she also generally looks and feels a lot more comfortable with what she's doing on stage (though she is a little out of breath at the end!). She's also not got her hair in plats for this performance, instead opting for having her hair tied back - it looks good to me! It's not a perfect performance - the giant CH leopard on the backdrop feels a bit random, and she's over-selling the 'emotional' stripped back penultimate chorus a bit, but this makes a strong end of the semi. Welcome back Luxembourg!

EDIT: Mods who are more familiar with female haircare than me say that this is probably just Tali without her hair done properly.

**17:25CEST:** Very efficiently, Malin and Petra kick off the voting. Europe, start voting now!

**Recap:** For now we see random volunteers standing in for the artists in the greenroom! The lady being Silvester Belt is loving it and hilariously it seems to be just a handful of volunteers changing seats! Most of the delegations have gone for the final chorus for their snippets. Bambie goes for the screamo at the very end. We must be cursed because the stream froze *again* in time for Croatia's snippet!

**Interval Act:** Johnny Logan gets a very complimentary introduction complete with emotional background music. Not quite sure why they decided to show clips of his winning performances when he's about to perform them again anyway. Ah, that's why - he's singing an orchestral ballad version of Euphoria, complete with an orchestra! It feels more Disney ballad than Johnny Logan ballad, but he's still got the pipes for it!

**Green Room:** Or should I say the 'pink room', to be more accurate. Luxembourg get a special shoutout and an interview with fake Tali about Luxembourg's victories. Tali's stand in is loving it! The point is made that this is the first time in Tali's lifetime that Luxembourg have participated in Eurovision, which is indeed a fun fact!

We then get a recap of some of the looks from the Turquoise carpet.

**Recap 2:** To clarify, UK/Germany/Sweden aren't shown in the recaps as they aren't 'competing acts' in this semi. To me, Ireland remains the clear standout because of how stylised the camerawork is, though plenty of other countries look great on the recap. The difference in quality between the first and second halves is pretty stark to me.

**Europe, stop voting now!** Petra and Malin end the voting by segwaying into a brief skit with the 'Australian commentators', who are upside down of course. After a brief technical delay, Petra has a brief skit about the app with a 'random member of the audience', and then Malin references Belgium 1973's husband and wife duo and dance moves and calls it the first 'Eurovision slay', which is a bit cringy. There's then a 'brief legacy of dance' in Eurovision, showing clips from a lot of different performances across Eurovision history.

**17:49CEST:** We're now back in the green room with Petra, who makes a joke about providing snacks including a baby lasagna and also refers to herself as 'mother' before giving some fun facts about some of the artists, including Bambie being half Swedish. Then back with Malin on the main stage, who introduces Benjamin Ingrosso...

**Interval Act:** Benjamin Ingrosso looks completely different to in 2018 - you'd think he's a completely different person given the vocal style is quite different to 2018 too! Not too much to say here, there's some cool angles with the ceiling lights and he performs some of his greatest hits well (including 'Kite'), though with everything else from the postcards to the skits referencing the history of Eurovision it does feel a bit out of place to me! The third song sees dancers finally emerge to join him on stage. The dancers and band are wearing what I'd described as 'Maneskin red' leather. This third song is very groovy and presumably the Swedes in the audience will be loving it.

**17:59CEST:** Malin and Petra introduce a brief recap through a series of random performances from the past twenty or so years, showcasing the breadth of genres at ESC, including Germany 2009, Serbia and Montenegro 2004, Italy 2015, San Marino 2019, Croatia 2006 and others.

**Qualifiers Announcement:** With Petra and Malin now equipped with the usual scoring table thing, the LED screen at the back finally opens up 2011 style to reveal the artists behind stage. Malin continues talking over it which is a little strange. Even Martin Osterdahl gets some emotional music for some reason, and a quiet splatter of applause to accompany his traditional 'good to go'.

The fake qualifiers (completely randomised) are: Portugal, Australia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Poland (with Luna offkey in the clip! D:), Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Serbia, Slovenia and finally ... Finland! Which would mean no Croatia which is not going to happen :P

When the qualifier is announced, we get a splitscreen of their reaction with a clip from their performance. As in previous years it slows down a little for the final three (although Malin jumped the gun a bit in announcing Serbia!).

Thanks for joining us! A couple of other mods will be taking you through the 'jury final' tonight from 21:00CEST using Reddit Live.",1715001614.0,2024-05-06T23:20:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1clivqy/live_commentary_semifinal_1_dress_rehearsal_1/
Article: What does the ESC cost the participating countries? (with answers!),1cld399,24,"**TL;DR**

• EBU provides hosting country with a base amount of around 6.2 million euros 

• The 6.2 euros are financed proportionally by the participating countries (participation fee)

• The broadcaster of the host country has to pay additional 10-20 millions from its own pocket (made possible through sponsorship)

**Longer Version** *translated by AI* 

(…) **But is participating in the ESC really that expensive?**

A significant part of the total costs for participating countries is the fee they must pay to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) to participate in the competition at all. Compared to other TV broadcasts, this fee is relatively low, but it has steadily increased in recent years (…)

Shortly before that, Swedish television SVT announced that the participation fee would increase, without providing precise information on the future amount. This is said to be due, among other things, to Russia's non-participation, but its cause is probably primarily due to generally increased production costs.

**ESC fees for individual participating countries:**

Although sums for some countries can be found in the media, many broadcasters refrain from publishing them.

Country + Fees to the EBU / partially rounded

Germany (2015)
363,500 euros

Germany (2017)
380,000 euros

Germany (2018)
400,800 euros

Germany (2019)
405,100 euros

Germany (2021)
396,452 euros

Germany (2022)
407,000 euros

Germany (2023)
473,000 euros

Greece (2012)
120,000 euros

Greece (2023)
150,000 euros

Ireland (2013)
70,000 euros

Malta (2010)
80,000 euros

Montenegro (2012)
23,000 euros

Netherlands (2016)
250,000 euros

North Macedonia (2022)
39,143 euros

Romania (2014)
130,000 euros

Switzerland (2016)
63,500 euros

Spain (2015)
356,000 euros

Spain (2022)
640,000 euros

Spain (2023)
347,700 euros

The fact that the participation fees vary so widely has something to do with the EBU's redistribution system: Each full member of the broadcasting union is assigned a point value based on its reach and the usage of Eurovision offerings (including news footage and sports broadcasts). Based on these point values, the total costs for joint productions are distributed among the individual participating states. In financing the ESC, the EBU provides the hosting country with a base amount of around 6.2 million euros, as reported by the newspaper ""Daily Star."" These funds are then financed by the countries broadcasting the ESC as a participation fee proportionally through redistribution. The hosting broadcasting organization must then contribute between 10 and 20 million euros from its own pocket, which is also made possible through sponsorship.

(…)

**Are the Big Five really the paymasters of the ESC?**

Despite claims that the Big Five countries (Germany, UK, Spain, Italy, and France) finance the lion's share of the ESC production costs, the actual numbers suggest otherwise. While they contribute the highest participation fees, they're not necessarily the main financiers of the competition. For instance, Germany's contribution to the total cost of around 11 million euros for the ESC in Turin was only 3.7 percent, as countries contribute only through their fee redistribution. Similarly, Spain's share of the total costs of around 15 million euros for the ESC in Vienna was just 2.4 percent. Being the paymaster seems somewhat different. The overall balance is similar for the other Big Five countries, but the complaints about fee waste are louder in countries with lackluster performance.

**Total costs versus benefits**

In fact, the Eurovision Song Contest is a comparatively inexpensive TV format for the hosting broadcasters. British economist Stephen Boyle calculated in 2016 that the 14.3 million euros (note: not officially confirmed by SVT) estimated by Swedish TV as the pure production costs for all three shows in Stockholm, for example, correspond to the costs of broadcasting rights for a Premier League football match. In return for the ESC, broadcasters get TV entertainment that they could hardly produce at this level themselves.

A similar calculation was made in 2015 on eurovision-spain.com regarding the costs of the Spanish broadcaster TVE: According to this, the price for one minute of ESC broadcast was 791 euros, while one minute of a 2016 UEFA European Championship football match (with a similar expected viewership) cost 21,600 euros. It begs the question: If it didn't pay off, wouldn't they have stopped it long ago?

**ESC pays off for ARD - and the hosts**

The ESC entry fees for Germany in 2023 are significantly below the average production costs of prime-time entertainment shows. The value in return is high, consisting of broadcasting the ESC final and the two semi-finals - a total of around eight hours of television.

Host cities like Turin or this year's Liverpool emphasize the importance of the Eurovision Song Contest for the local economy and society. The EBU itself has produced a report on the sustainable impact of the competition in 2022, which might be worth reading before calling for the next withdrawal from the contest.

Ranking the Top 52 Eurovision Song Contest Countries since 1975: Coming into their own (#20-#16),1cirzpn,3,"T-Minus 1 week until the next edition of the very contest we all love and enjoy. We are approaching the best of the best that this contest has to offer, as we are in the top 20! These countries represent 40 of the 50 highest ranked songs since 1975, which just shows how much all of these countries have contributed to the longest running singing competition. 

## The Countries

| Placement | Country         | Score      |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------- |  
| 16	    | Malta           | 140231.278 |
| 17	    | Spain           | 138804.573 |

We are getting some big hitters now! At #20, we have Turkey, who first participated at the start of this time period and is really a late bloomer to this competition, as they started to get consistently great results in the 2000s, the last full decade they would participate in. Coming in in front of Turkey is our second Nordic nation in Finland, who like Turkey really struggled to place well at this competition until their Magnum opus arrived, which really shook the foundation of who could win at this contest, and since then have really started to come into their own, embracing their wacky nature. Above them is Austria, who is the oldest ESC nation on this list so far, getting their start in only the contest’s second year, 1957. They actually had one of the longest winless streaks in Eurovision since their first win in 1966, taking 48 tries after that to claim their second crown.  Our first “Big Five” nation comes up at #17, with Spain, as they are part of some of the wackiest results ever at this contest, and in back to back years as well! The reason why they are the lowest ranked “Big Five” nation is because they really bottomed out in the 2000s and 2010s, only recently finding redemption in the early 2020s. And at #16 on our list is Malta, who have participated in every edition of ESC since ‘91, and is the best performing country to never win Eurovision, considering that they are the only country in the top 20 to not have one ESC crown on their resume, which is a big shame, considering the bangers they have given us over the years.

## The Worst Years

### Austria | 2015 | [The Makemakes - I Am Yours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f993p0CAV8)
***Contest Ranking***: 26th (last, 0 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 39th (last, -3.9)

What a difference a year makes! Coming off high from their win in 2014, their first in almost 50 years,  Austria was set to host this year’s edition. As such, they had a free pass to the Grand Final, with their song “I Am Yours” performed by The Makemakes, an Austrian pop rock band. I didn’t think much of this song when I initially heard it, so imagine my shock when I saw that it didn’t receive a single point on the final scoreboard. I actually don’t know why this got last place, maybe this entry is an example of the douze points system rearing its ugly head, or maybe no one remembered to vote for this song at the end. Either way, this is a confusing entry in the Hall of *nul points*. And because there were so many countries that year, this song sinks far to the depths of this club. 

### Turkey | 1987 | [Seyyal Taner and Grup Lokomotif - Şarkım Sevgi Üstüne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOHSvWXnVII)
***Contest Ranking***: 22nd (last, 0 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 22nd (last, -2.1)

A common theme you will see here for countries like Turkey or Finland or any non Western European Country (besides Portugal), is that with the language rules, they would struggle to do well at all, especially in the 80’s and 90’s, where English was overtaking French as the dominant language of Eurovision. It would take some time for these countries to find a formula that transcends language (see [Turkey 1997](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5J6-bCMz3Y) for more details), but for now it would be rough sailing for Turkey and these other countries to appeal the juries. That doesn’t mean that bangers weren’t being sent in though! This song seems like it would be the opening for a space odyssey or something, it just has that feel. Unfortunately, a little nervousness would doom this performance, scoring zero points** in Belgium. 

### Spain | 1983 | [Remedios Amaya - Quién maneja mi barca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3-0DLbQP2E)
***Contest Ranking***: 19th (last, 0 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 19th (last, -1.9)

Ok, so I kind of take back what I said about only Western European countries doing well in this era of ESC. Spain, like Portugal, struggled mightily when they entered in 1961. They already had two last place, nul point entries by the year 1968, where they would pull off one of the most infamous wins in Eurovision history, pipping the United Kingdom by a singular point. The year after they would have  *another* infamous win at this contest, sharing the win with the UK, France, and The Netherlands. Since then, it would be alright for Spain… until this year, where they would have ****another*** last place, nul point entry. This one probably didn’t deserve the honor, and I say “probably” because after listening to this song, I’m confused on where it *should* place. Probably not last though. People say that ESC was not ready for this type of music, which I probably agree with, I just don’t know ***when*** ESC would be ready for this type of music though. 


** Turkey only has two entries that have scored *nul points* at ESC, with the other one being in 1983

### Finland | 1982 | [Kojo - Nuku pommiin](https://cookiefonster.com/2023/08/25/cookie-fonsters-feelings-over-eurovision-1982-germanys-time-to-shine/)
***Contest Ranking***: 18th (last, 0 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 22nd (last, -1.7)

Like I said, tough sledding for the non Western European Countries, especially tough for the Nordic nations, who really were seen as jokes at this competition for the longest time (really until Sweden and Norway went back to back in ‘84 and ‘85). Fortunately for Finland, this time period gets rid of two other last place, nil point performances in 1963 and 1965. This also doesn’t count their 1 point performance in 1968, but I think you get the point. They have finished last six** Other times since 1975 however, and since they do not have as many hits as their Nordic contemporaries (sans Iceland), they are only 19th. Anyway, while Germany ran away with the contest singing a song about peace (another ESC staple), Finland would obtain last place with a song about peace, in particular a song about protesting nuclear bombs. While Germany’s song was a neatly composed song that was nice on the ears, this one is the complete opposite, so it’s fitting that this one finished last. I would say more but I don’t want to listen to this song again, so…

** Six last place performances in the Grand Final, they have an additional two last place finishes in the semifinals. 





### Malta | 2017 | [Claudia Faniello - Breathlessly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bfoq7udRPwk)
***Contest Ranking***: DNQ (16th 2nd Semifinal , 55 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 22nd (41st, 0.062)

Malta surprisingly has not had an entry receiving nul points (though 2016 and 2023 are very, very close). But they have struggled to qualify in the last 8 years, only qualifying twice in that span. This entry was one that did not make the cut, a decent ballad that just didn’t work with enough people, which is unfortunate. Malta used to rule with dramatic ballads, in fact, all of their top 3 finishes (sans 2002), were ballads, so they do know what they are doing in this department. Maybe like Ireland, their type of ballads just don’t work anymore in modern Eurovision, which is sad to say, but maybe Malta can reinvent themselves and be back on top one day!

## The Best Years

### Malta | 2021 | [Destiny - Je me casse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQKiHr5qEfA)
***Contest Ranking***: 7th (255 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 6th (398.4*)

Surprised? Like I said earlier Malta have sent in some classics to this competition, this one included. Despite the fact that there are at least 3 other songs with higher placements, none of them were able to outperform Destiny, our second COVID participant! Before this entry, she was more well known for winning Eurovision for Malta! Well, it was actually Junior Eurovision, but still, that is a heck of an achievement to have in your locker. She has also appeared on Britain’s Got Talent, and she has also won the X Factor in Malta, so safe to say she definitely has the talent to compete! From the ESC website, she says that her dream was to represent Malta and obtain that first victory for her country, and with the support of former Maltese entrant [Ira Losco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-7lnc5uWrk), she would get the chance to do so with her song “All of My Soul” for ESC 2020… and well you know what happened after that. But for 2021, she will have another opportunity to achieve her dream with her new song “Je Me Casse”. 
	This song is just energy personified. Destiny said that her influences for singing were Lizzo, Beyonce, Aretha Franklin, Cardi B, and Megan Thee Stallion, women who are known for their energy that they bring to every performance. She definitely brings it here, with her song about empowerment and breaking free. Destiny has a powerful voice as well, which really helps bring out the emotion in this song, commanding the attention of everyone who watched it! When I heard this song for the first time, I immediately thought she would win, the song just has that winning energy surrounding it, and Destiny is the main reason why. Unfortunately for Destiny and for Malta, while this song would finish in the top 10, it would not be the one for the country, as they end up 7th, which is pretty respectable considering the stacked lineup for this year. Even more unfortunately for Malta, they haven’t qualified to the Grand Final since that year (even though it’s only been two years). Who knows, maybe in the future Destiny can come back for Malta to get the elusive crown, if Portugal can win one, anything is possible.   

*  This song is ranked ***68th*** of all entries since 1975

### Turkey | 2004 | [Athena - For Real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pipamUl14A4)
***Contest Ranking***: 4th (195  pts)  
***My Ranking***: 4th (401.842*)


The most points Turkey has ever received at Eurovision, which is crazy to say considering the renaissance they were going through at the time. No it’s not their only win that takes the top spot (3 way battles tend to make the winner’s score weaker, and according to my formula Turkey didn’t even win this year), but rather the entry *after* it, that does. Meet the rock/ska band Athena, regarded as one of the best rock bands in Turkey. The band got their start in 1987, formed by twin brothers Gökhan Özoğuz and Hakan Özoğuz. After releasing their first album, they switched their style from rock centered to ska centered, which is like a fusion of punk rock and ska music (basically there are a lot of trumpets, trombones, and woodwind instruments). Once they switched their style they caught fire in Turkey, which culminated in a large tour of their country as well as opening for the Rolling Stones(!). They were selected by the Turkish broadcaster to be the host’s act for ESC 2004. 
	I was wondering what this song was, considering that I didn’t recognize it when I started writing this piece. But then the song started, and I was like “Oh, *this* song”, which is nothing against the band, because this song is pretty decent! The ska influence still rings large in this entry, with the horns blaring throughout the song. Songs like this tend to be really catchy, with this one being no exception. Other examples of songs like this that I can name off the top of my head are “Alcohol is Free” in 2013 and Turkey’s future entry in “We Could Be The Same” in 2010. While ""For Real"" may not have been immediately recognizable to some compared to the other two, its infectious charm quickly captures attention. It finished 4th, showcasing the future promise of songs from this region, while continuing Turkey’s strong period that would disappointingly end with their withdrawal in the early 2010s. 

This entry is ranked ***65th*** of all songs since 1975. 



### Spain | 2022 | [Chanel - 	SloMo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mYBiIO0pfY)
***Contest Ranking***: *3rd* (459 pts)  
***My Ranking***: *3rd* (481.959**)

Their best result in decades, and it is in the most sexy Spanish way! After a turbulent 2010s, which included several finishes in the 20s, a last place finish (which contained a legendary voice crack), it seemed to be more of the same in the 2020s, as their 2021 entry only received 6 measly points and a 24th placement. Then Chanel appeared. Born in Cuba, Chanel Terrero Martínez moved to Spain at the age of 6. Once she moved to Spain, she began taking acting, singing, and ballet classes, culminating in her beginning her musical theater journey when she was 16. Chanel featured in many Spanish shows and musical productions, and she almost got the part of the musical West Side Story, directed by Steven Spilburg. Notice how I haven’t mentioned much about her singing, it’s because her musical career started very recently! Chanel decided to participate in Benidorm Fest 2022, with her debut single called “SloMo”. This song had a lot of hands in production, as Chanel worked with stars like Jennifer Lopez, Britney Spears, among others. The effort would be worth it, as she won the Festival, claiming her ticket to Turin for ESC 2022. 
	The last time Spain finished in the Top 5, you would have to go all the way back to the year 1995, with Anabel Conde delivering a Eurovision classic with the song ""Vuelve conmigo"", which finished 2nd to Norway’s entry. That song was a slow, methodical ballad, ***this*** song is the complete opposite, it leaves almost everyone (including the singer) breathless! Like with Destiny, this song is pure energy, but this entry falls in line with the typical “sexy Spanish energy”, and when you look at the performance (this link is for the Benidorm version), I mean, the woman literally says “booty hypnotic” about 6 times! Singing wise, it’s nothing special, but the performance really takes this to another level. It’s like Spain got the memo that Latvia sent out about how performance really drives an entry about 20 years too late. But they definitely got the message alright! It must be difficult to be a fan of Spain at Eurovision, considering that the country has been swimming in mediocrity along with its fellow Big Five brethren (except for Italy and sometimes France/UK, but definitely with Germany). But when the stars align, this is what Spain can do, and it’s so amazing when they do it! Spain in this contest's history really surprises you when they do well, and then you wonder why they can’t do this more often, only to disappear until the next great performance, rinse and repeat. Maybe after this entry and last year’s one (which got robbed of a better placement), Spain can finally flex their might at this competition, and one day we may go back to Spain for an ESC! 

** This song is one of the ***Top 50*** ESC songs since 1975. 

### Austria | 2014 | [Conchita Wurst - Rise Like a Phoenix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRUIava4WRM)
***Contest Ranking***: ***1st*** (290 pts)  
***My Ranking***: ***1st*** (602.765**)

48 years between podium finishes, but what a way to do it! Austria occupies an interesting place within ESC lore. At the beginning of their journey, they weren’t much of anything, and it took a certain Udo Jürgens performing three times in back to back to back years to finally take the crown for the country. Since then, nothing much, just wading in the ESC waters, with the occasional decent tune once in a while. Then comes 2014. Austria up to this point were not known to be that influential in Eurovision, but then there was Conchita Wurst, who changed that perception in about 3 minutes. But first, some backstory. Conchita Wurst is the drag persona of   Tom Neuwirth, who had a long career before joining the ESC stage. He was the founding member of a boy band in the early 2010s, and before that embarked on his singing career through an Austrian casting show. In 2011, Tom would start appearing as Conchita Wurst, a name literally meaning “Vagina (Spanish slang) Penis (German slang)” Conchita is also well noted for having a beard, a decision consciously made because as Tom/Conchita put it, “you can achieve anything, no matter who you are or how you look”. In 2012, Conchita almost became the representative for Austria at Eurovision, but narrowly lost out to Trackshittaz by 2% of the vote. In 2014, Conchita would not need a vote, as the national broadcaster would select Wurst and the song “Rise Like A Phoenix”  to perform in Copenhagen. 
Now Conchita’s inclusion in ESC did not come without its outroar of disapproval, specifically from conservative groups in Eastern Europe. There were even petitions made for the local broadcasters to cut out Conchita’s performance entirely. Of course there were comparisons made between Conchita and Dana International, not only because of the LGBT likeness but also because of the threats and disapproval they both received prior to the contest. This disapproval would extend onto the ESC stage, as Armenia’s representative that year would make various remarks about how Conchita wasn’t living a “natural life”***. That wouldn’t stop the drag queen however, as Wurst would go on to deliver a stunning ballad, appropriately about how she would rise from the ashes of her haters to become stronger. It reminds me of James Bond music, just with the horns and the overall vibe of the song. The entry was meant to be serious and on that note it succeeded, and overall it just has the commanding energy that so many winning songs demonstrate. This entry would not only win for Austria, breaking a nearly 50 year drought****, but would become one of the most iconic ESC entries of the 21st century, maybe even ever! Like with 1998, this would open the door for LGBT visibility in this contest, something that would only be embraced more and more in the years since this song took gold.  


** This song is one of the  ***Top 50*** ESC songs since 1975.   
*** He would say that those comments were a joke, but you get the picture   
**** The 2010’s (and some of the 2020s) overall were really an era of breaking droughts. You got Germany (first since 1982), Azerbaijan (first ever), Sweden (first since 1999), Denmark (first since 2001), Austria (first since 1966), Sweden (first since 2012 lol), Ukraine (first since 2004), Portugal (first ever), Israel (first since 1998), and the Netherlands (first since 1975) all winning. Maybe countries like France (1977), Spain (1969) the UK (1998), even Ireland (1997, and who am I kidding, this drought will not be broken for a long time) could break their droughts as well?


### Finland | 2023 | [Käärijä - Cha Cha Cha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJHe-iZ5HSI)
***Contest Ranking***: *2nd* (526 pts)  
***My Ranking***: ***1st*** (732.848**)

All of the songs on this list have surprised me, sans Austria and Spain. Finland’s best ever performing entry prior to 2023 was Lordi’s “Hard Rock Halleujah”, an entry that broke the barrier on what type of entries could win at this competition. Lordi’s song will forever remain in ESC lore, and for Finland it would be at the top of a surprisingly lackluster list. Outside of Lordi,there is only one other entry that has a score of over 150 (basically Top 7ish) prior to 2023, which was Blind Channel’s song “Dark Side” in 2021. Finland when it comes to the power of Scandinavia at this contest are really only above Iceland when it comes to performance and impact. The other three countries are ***loaded*** with iconic songs and impact to this competition, something that Finland has been lacking, until recently. Of course there’s Lordi and in 2021 there was Blind Channel, but both of those songs demonstrate what Finland can bring to this competition, which is hard party rock, and that is perfectly demonstrated with the song many people thought should have won, “Cha Cha Cha”, performed by Käärijä. Käärijä, or Jere Mikael Pöyhönen is a rapper and songwriter, known for his bowl cut and his shirtlessness, with the ladder having a nice sentiment driving it.*** There are many more things that he is known for and has done, from how his name is a play on the word for gambling in Finnish, to how he mostly performed shirtless due to the fact that his original yellow suit would get too hot, but you are all here for me to talk about the song, so let’s get to it. 
There are many similarities between this song and “Hard Rock Hallejah”, but the similarity that matters most is the fact that these songs are so unapologetically themselves. They both invite you to join their worlds, promising a hell of a time if one were to accept the invitation. While Lordi’s song involved the “acrocoplis” this song involves a party, a crazy party, nonetheless. I think what works the best for this song is that despite the fact that all of the lyrics are in Finnish, the first time that has happened for Finland since 2010, the chorus is where ***everyone*** can let loose, and boy does it let you. The roars you hear when the audience says “CHA CHA CHA CHA CHA CHA CHA EY” are really a testament to how much energy this song has (I feel like I’ve said this a lot today). This song is pure fun, and it’s such a joy to go through all of the acts with Käärijä. Did this song deserve to win? Well… yes and no. This song did get the highest televoting percentage of any entry not named “Stefania”, even surpassing Portugal’s entry in 2017. And if you see my contest ranking, according to my formula it placed first. On those fronts, it deserved to win. Does this song carry more winning energy than Sweden? Yes, but then I’m reminded of 2007, and how the more serious song (“Molitva”) won over the more campy fun song (""Dancing Lasha Tumbai""). From the history of ESC, the more serious songs win out most of the time, so I can see why this song didn’t surpass Sweden. Do I think this song deserved to win? Well I’m torn. Both songs have the potential to win, and I love both of them for different reasons. I could talk about it more, but this is a Finland post, and this song could have the impact of Ukraine 2007, even if it didn’t win. What this song has done is raise Finland’s profile in ESC and in my rankings, because without this song Finland may be below Iceland in the rankings. 

** This song is one of the  ***Top 50*** ESC songs since 1975.   
*** Basically Käärijä said that going topless should be more accepted, no matter what size you are, which is a pretty cool message if you ask me. 


## Final Thoughts

So what do you think? Do you believe that Finland deserved to win last year? Which country here has delivered the biggest impact to ESC? Will Malta ever join the winner’s circle at Eurovision? And who will be next?

Ranking The Top 52 Eurovision Song Contest Countries since 1975: It's Fire! (#27-#21),1ccxefd,2,"Less than 3 weeks until the big day (or week should I say)! We are getting closer and closer to Eurovision 2024, and on this list we are getting closer and closer to the top countries! Today, I wanted to talk about SEVEN countries instead of the usual five, just to speed things up a little. After this, we will be inside the top 20! How exciting is that?

## The Countries

| Placement | Country         | Score      |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------- |  
| 21	    | Iceland         | 107179.671 |
| 22	    | Portugal        | 106523.009 |
| 23	    | Cyprus	      | 105419.358 |
| 24	    | Azerbaijan      | 105202.941 |
| 25	    | Estonia         | 102815.336 | 
| 26	    | Moldova         | 88264.205  | 
| 27	    | Australia       | 87362.167  | 


We are now getting to more and more countries that debuted before the 1990's! At #27 is the youngest and latest country to participate in ESC with Australia. With only 8 entries (about to be 9), they are close to the top half of the board, which is incredibly impressive in its own right! Just above them is Moldova, a slightly older participant than Australia (10 years), who have really come into their own the last 8 ish years, which have skyrocketed them up into 26th place! Entering into the 6 digit club is Estonia, the first in a long chain of first time winners in the 2000's. For me personally, they have surprised me with their early consistency in the contest, which is a lot of the reason they are up so high. Getting inside the top 25 now is Azerbaijan, the third youngest* country to participate at ESC, who like Estonia burst onto the scene (in slightly more controversial ways), which included a win in 2011. Shining above them is Cyprus, probably the most ""fire"" country here (ignoring Azerbaijan), even if they only have one singular highlight at this contest since the turn of the millennium. At #22 is Portugal, a country who were stubbornly steadfast in their ways, which somehow worked off for them (eventually)! And at the top of this batch is our first Scandinavian country in Iceland, who unfortunately are seen as the younger sibling in the Nordic family, both literally and metaphorically. But that doesn't mean they didn't shine on their own!

* The second youngest contestant would be San Marino

## The Worst Years

### Portugal | 1997 | [Célia Lawson - Antes do adeus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aotGh0dard4)
***Contest Ranking***: 24th (0 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 24th (-2.4)

Portugal occupy this weird place in ESC lore. They don't have the most last places finishes (that would go to Norway), the most nil points, they just... float around in the ESC underbelly, sometimes coming into the spotlight, but for the most part are just content to come to the stage, sing their native song, and then go off into the sunset, until the next year. That is what this song feels like for me, and that's perfectly ok. They did their thing, and they went off into the sunset, never to be seen again, until next year.

### Iceland | 1989 | [Daníel - Það sem enginn sér](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UQfCtIxn_s)
***Contest Ranking***: 22nd (0 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 22nd (-2.1)

Iceland were consistent in their early years at ESC. Like their Scandinavian siblings in prior years, they had trouble finding their way past the language barrier, and like their siblings, they seemed stuck in mediocrity (16th place) until a flash of brilliance sparked them for decades to come! In this case, that spark would happen next year, but for this song, it got the country out of 16th place! It was into last and it did place them into the ***nil points** club, but that's something at least! As for the song, well there is a reason I'm not talking about it much, but there's not much of a song to talk about. 


### Azerbaijan | 2023 | [TuralTuranX - Tell Me More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dvsr-L3HgY)
***Contest Ranking***: DNQ (14th 1st Semifinal)  
***My Ranking***: 35th (0.455)

So after Azerbaijan's meteoric rise, which included 6 top 10 finishes, 5 top five placements, three podium finishes and one victory, you would be pretty shocked to know that the success they had would not be repeated, as they have had one (1) top TEN finish since then. This song would only be the second entry from this country to not make it to the GF, but I mean I can see why. For all of Azerbaijan's... issues inside and outside this competition, they sure did know how to make some bangers (It's unfortunate that I might say that sentence again for another couple countries). This entry is  not one of those bangers, it's just dull, and unmemorable. Heck, I don't even know how the song goes, and I JUST listened to it. 

### Estonia | 2008 | [Kreisiraadio - Leto svet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRh9PzNYD-8)
***Contest Ranking***: DNQ (18th 1st Semifinal)  
***My Ranking***: 41st (0.669)

After coming second in 2002, right after winning in 2001, Estonia must have felt that they were on top of the world. Then they finished 21st. And after that they would kick off a five year NQ streak in 2004, with this entry being at the tailend. In a year full of joke entries, this one stands out for being the most... colorful. This one was conducted by 3 well known Estonian comedians Hannes Võrno, Peeter Oja and Tarmo Leinatamm, who combined to form Kreisiraadio, who would produce this colorful monstrosity of a song, talking about... *checks notes* nonsense, complete and utter nonsense. Yeah you already know this didn't qualify. A rainbow mark on such a weird year for Eurovision. 

### Moldova | 2014 | [Cristina Scarlat - Wild Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ZfGttI4P0)
***Contest Ranking***: DNQ (16th 1st Semifinal)  
***My Ranking***: 36th (1.015)

I'm glad that Moldova found out what they were good at after this, because man this was hard to watch. Cristina Scarlat would have the honor   of continuing a solid and steady streak for Moldova. It was all going well too, until they brought out the dubstep... why did they bring out the dubstep? This song would have been fine without it. Would they have qualified? Probably not, but they wouldn't have finished last, which this song fell to. 


### Australia | 2021 | [Montaigne - Technicolour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghT5QderxCA)
***Contest Ranking***: DNQ (14th 1st Semifinal)  
***My Ranking***: 34th (1.519)

We have our first COVID participant! Montaigne, who was a singer on the rise in Australia, had the chance to represent her country at ESC in 2020... but then that didn't happen. But Australia were one of many countries that allowed their 2020 artists to go again, so here we have Monatiagne's second attempt at an ESC song. And to be honest, it's not as good as her 2020 song. There was just something missing for this one, and the people agreed, as this is to this day Australia's only NQ, which is obviously why this is one this list.

### Cyprus | 1999 | [Marlain - Tha'ne erotas (Θα'ναι έρωτας)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABU7gCbilS8)
***Contest Ranking***: 22nd (2 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 22nd (0.924)

Cyprus has had maybe two entries in the past 30 odd years that are still talked about to this day. They came out strong in the early 80's, but have slowly faded away to being part of the ethnic flavor of the competition. This song may be part of the reason why. Before this entry, Cyprus had finished in the top 11 for five years straight, looking to gain some momentum for the new millennium. But this confusing ballad/eurodance song halted all of that progress, sending any hope of Cyprus success away, and ensuring that all of their fans/citizens hop on the Greece Train, which was about to rapidly take off. 


## The Best Years

### Iceland | 2009 | [Yohanna - Is It True?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqE69feyEOU)
***Contest Ranking***: *2nd* (218 pts)  
***My Ranking***: *2nd* (413.374*)


Iceland have finished 2nd twice in their history. Both times were in years ending in 9**, both times featured a female led vocal with background singers to their left, and both would finish second to their better well known Scandinavian sibling entries, which is very tragic, considering the quality of both of these songs. 2009 takes the cake for being the best of the rest, considering the massive gap between this one, and Norway's entry that year. Anyway,Iceland have finished 2nd twice in their history. Both times were in years ending in 9**, both times featured a female led vocal with background singers to their left, and both would finish second to their better well known Scandinavian sibling entries, which is very tragic, considering the quality of both of these songs. 2009 takes the cake for being the best of the rest, considering the massive gap between this one, and Norway's entry that year. Anyway, here is Yohanna, or should I say Jóhanna Guðrún Jónsdóttir, who is actually not from Iceland, but rather from Denmark. She began performing at the age of nine, covering famous songs in Icelandic. She would step away from music for about six years, and when she came back she entered into Iceland's national final with her song, which would eventually win the contest and earn the right to go to Moscow for ESC '09, which ended up being one of the great contests in the 21st century. 

This song has a particular aura around it, it's just so beautiful. And it's not just the song, it's her voice, it's the staging, it's just the presence of the song combined with the passion thrown in which makes it really stand out. This for me is when the ballad became modernized for Eurovision, as many other ballads in the 2000's kind of just blend together, just sort of bland all together. But this song changes all of that. It's the way she tells the story throughout the song, and the stunning realization that her love cheated on her! That part really surprised me, and it at the same time really ties the message of the song together. It feels so innocent but then the song gets kind of dark at the end and you don't expect it, even though it is an ESC love song, which generally have a formula to them. The way she says ""Is it True?"" at the end gives me chills, and it is somehow always heartbreaking every time I hear it, which not many songs do to me. it feels kind of unfair that this song had to compete this year, as this edition of ESC was STACKED, which makes it more impressive that it finished runners up competing with Turkey, Azerbaijan, and well... Norway. Iceland feels like a country that should have won ESC with that one particular song that has its space in ESC lore, kinda like Belgium with their win in 1986. Unfortunately, that is not how this works, but for this masterpiece to be at the top for a country that has carved out their own identity in the years since, is really, really cool.

### Azerbaijan | 2013 | [Farid Mammadov - Hold Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN3d_V7KVLE)
***Contest Ranking***: *2nd* (234 pts)  
***My Ranking***: *2nd* (418.843*)

Were you expecting this song to take the top spot? I would have thought 2011, 2009 or even 2019 to take the mantle but this one surprised me! Like I said earlier, Azerbaijan's run when they first entered the contest was the stuff of legend, never finishing outside the top 10 with each of their first six entries. This was #6/6 of those entries, and this song is probably the most controversial entry of the bunch, which is surprising considering that 2011 exists. But let’s move on to the singer, whose name is Farid Mammadov, who for the longest time was interested in soul and jazz, citing Stevie Wonder as one of his inspirations growing up. Farid became the first solo male representative for the country in 2013 after winning his country’s national final, but I bet you already know that. 

Now I was out of the loop regarding any scandals that might have happened this year, and it wasn’t until researching this song that I saw the controversy surrounding this entry (On a side note, I was confused that the official ESC youtube page turned off comments, which prompted my investigation). It is very tragic that from many sources, Azerbaijan tried to bribe the delegations from several countries in order to get a higher score, in which they succeeded, for the most part. This song didn’t win, it was about 50 points off from Denmark’s entry that year, who was the eventual winner, but it makes me think, where *would* this entry place  if not for the attempted rigging? This song is not that bad, it has a nice tune, but again it’s not that memorable, and it feels a bit basic. Maybe Azerbaijan’s top 10 streak should have ended this year, and now that I know about the scandal, it puts into question the other entries that they have sent prior to this one, because a country doesn’t just randomly decide that this year would be the year to start tampering with the votes. Especially since they have placed so high many times already. Dang I already was lukewarm at best about 2011, but now…. Anyway, even though this song is nothing special, and it all likelihood it looks like their other results were marred as well… actually I don’t have much to say for that part. 2009 still slaps though. 

* This song is ranked ***60th*** of all ESC songs since 1975

### Estonia | 2001 | [Tanel Padar, Dave Benton and 2XL - Everybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEQa8Q9x5Ag)
***Contest Ranking***: ***1st*** (198 pts)  
***My Ranking***: ***1st*** (439.5**)

I don't even know where to begin with this one. I said in an earlier post that there was one winning song in the 2000’s that didn’t deserve their win. For me, this is that song. Estonia’s only victory at this contest came in 2001, when Tandel Padar, an Estonian singer that was coming on to the scene, combined with Dave Benton, an Aruban singer who was 50 at the time he performed, and 2XL, another Estonian act who would become *Soul Militia” and competed in 2007, to form one of the party songs of all time, called “Everybody”. When I heard this song for the first time, I was baffled. THIS song won Eurovision? Over Denmark? Over Greece? Over France? I don’t get it. Maybe it was the fact that it was televote only, meaning that the audience was susceptible to joyful happy party songs that just so happened to be at the end of the running order meaning that it would be fresh in your mind (To be fair, the rest of the top 3 performed after this one). It’s so *simple*, like a song you expect to finish middle of the pack, but after 10/23 votes, it was second only to Denmark (as seen by [this crowd reaction](https://youtu.be/1jfqkmKte2k?si=rKxP3mLoeCaCkxlp&t=8754). And then the 12’s kept pouring in… I was just stunned the rest of that voting sequence. I do got to hand it to them though, they were consistently doing better than second place Denmark for a majority of the votes, so what do I know about how much a song is liked?
  Now there have been strange acts that have won ESC before, like… um… wait… oh wow I just had a revelation. This song might have ushered in a new era of Eurovision. With this song and Latvia’s winning entry a year later, Eurovision was heading into unknown waters, as each year would usher in a first time winner, all the way until 2009. This was also a victory for Eastern Europe, as other countries in that region would follow suit in the years to come. It was also a victory for Black contestants, as Dave Benton become the first black ESC contestant to win the competition (it should have happened [10 years earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ESL6deuhJM), but I digress). That wouldn’t have happened if Denmark would have, nor would have been the increase of new countries winning right after this entry. So maybe I am being too harsh on this entry, but to this day I still wonder what went through the collective European mind that May day in 2001.

### Cyprus | 2018 | [Eleni Foureira - Fuego](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDSgs6syrgg)
***Contest Ranking***: *2nd* (436 pts)  
***My Ranking***: *2nd* (471.523**)

For a country that doesn't have many highlights at this competition, THIS is the way to make one, wow! Let’s talk about Eleni Foureira, aka Entela Fureraj, a Greek-Albanian singer who gained prominence as part of a girl group in the late 2000’s. She then went off on her own in 2009, releasing several albums that were well received in both Greece and Cyprus, which set her up well for her to one day compete in the ESC… for Greece. She tried several times to compete for Greece but came up short each time, which eventually led her to try again, but this time for Cyprus, in which she succeeded, and was one of three ethnically Albanian singers to sing that year in Portugal. 
Cyprus has been a country that has been overshadowed mightily in this contest. As a side effect of having such a strong bond with Greece, if your country was not doing well, everyone would just hop ship to their neighbor, which was exactly the case for Cyprus around the start of the 21st century, when Greece went into overdrive and eventually secured their first ESC win in 2005. Cyprus could revel in this achievement, since they and Greece are such best friends, but eventually you would want something for yourself no? This entry is the perfect metaphor for this, as even their own artist tried several times to be a part of the Greece train, and eventually trudged over to the less glamorous Cyprus hole (metaphorically, of course). But this entry roared Cyprus into life, really lighting up all of the competition. The song is “Fuego” and the performance is fire! To quote a “friend” of mine, “""Fuego"" took the Eurovision stage by storm with its infectious beat, sultry choreography, and Foureira's magnetic charisma. The song's catchy hooks and memorable chorus made it an instant hit, not only during the competition but also in the broader music scene. Its success can be attributed to its ability to blend contemporary pop sensibilities with ethnic flair, appealing to a wide audience.” It was just such a vibe, such a bop, so infectious, it would almost be insulting if it didn’t finish top 3. Now, I cannot off the top of my head name Cypriot entries that would come close to this one, and if I tried I would accidentally name a Greek song instead. Even though it didn’t result in a win, it has resulted in one of the most recognizable ESC songs in the last decade, which I think Cyprus would take as well.

### Moldova | 2022 | [Zdob și Zdub and Advahov Brothers - Trenulețul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGNT5Uh-WKw)
***Contest Ranking***: 7th (253 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 4th (481.542**)

What sweet redemption for the man who started it all for Moldova! Zdob și Zdub was the band that started it all for the country in 2005, with their song “Boonika bate doba”, which finished 6th that year. The band would come back 6 years later with the song “So Lucky” , which got a respectable 12th. The third time they came to this competition would be better than the last, and points wise would be the best they ever did. Here is the song, ""Trenulețul"", accompanied by the Advahov Brothers, another Moldovan based band. 
	This song is quite simply infectious. Whether it is talking about a happy train ride from Chișinău to Bucharest, or a union between Romania and Moldova, I don’t care that much about. What I do care about is how upbeat and joyful it sounds! For a year that had a lot of slow, methodical, and emotionally charged songs, this one stands out for the energy it brought to the stage, especially in the form of one of the members dressing up in a red sweatshirt and backwards cap, dishing out lyrics like it was pizza! There actually isn’t much else I wanted to add to this, except for the fact that outside of Ukraine, it was the highest among televoters, which is why it shot up the list despite the fact it finished 7th. It’s just so much fun to see the band do so well in multiple contests in different decades, and for them to have as much fun as they did as well.

### Australia | 2016 | [Dami Im - Sound of Silence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EG_Jtw4OyU)
***Contest Ranking***: *2nd* (511 pts)  
***My Ranking***: *3rd* (569.814**)

Australia 2015 (74th) --> Australia 2016 (Top 50)!  What a strong start for Australia! (I find myself saying this for many countries, perhaps there is a correlation between the two) But yes, Australia proved why they weren’t just a special guest, they have been watching this competition for decades before joining, so of course they wanted to put their best foot forward. Their 2015 entry was very nice, but this one really puts into perspective how serious the country was taking this contest, with the song “Sound of Silence”, performed by Dami Im, who emigrated to Australia from South Korea when she was only nine. She apparently learned English from various Kylie Minogue songs, which sparked her quite frankly incredible career (so far). She came to prominence by winning Australia’s *X Factor*, which led to her releasing a number one album. In fact, she was the first person to have a number one single followed by a number one album, which is incredibly impressive. She came to international recognition, performing in multiple countries and on multiple TV shows, before being called up by SBS to represent Australia at Eurovision in 2016. 
	In an interview before ESC, the head of the Australian delegation was asked about Im’s potential at this contest. He replied by saying that she is able to “feel an audience” and become a conductor of them, all intuitively. “She’s a lightning rod of emotion when she performs”, is part of what he said, and I cannot agree more! From the beginning, Im leads us on a musical journey (which is about love, of course), about how she is basically ghosted by her lover, and how she now has to awake to the “sound of silence” with them not being there for her. The build up in this song is fantastique, and the payoff of it is just magical! The way she sings the chorus, it’s just a rush of energy that goes through you everytime you hear it. She really commands a performance with her emotions, but she doesn’t let her emotions overtake the moment of the song, but rather her strong presence throughout the song. It’s quite breathtaking, and I do not know if I have heard a song like this before or since at this contest, it is quite remarkable. This song is jury bait, but they did take it, which ended up with her being at the top of the jury rankings. It was just the audience that didn’t connect with it quite as much as Ukraine or Russia, which is quite a shame, because it would have been cool for Australia to win on their 2nd try, something that was coincidentally done by Ukraine in 2004. Even though this song did not win, it really has established itself into the ESC lore for a country that still has so much left to write. 

** This entry is ranked in the ***Top 50*** of all ESC songs since 1975.
*** And yes, Australia 2015 is ranked ***74th*** of all ESC songs since 1975. 

### Portugal | 2017 | [Salvador Sobral -  Amar pelos dois](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymFVfzu-2mw)
***Contest Ranking***: ***1st*** (758 pts)  
***My Ranking***: ***1st*** (838.952**)

Wow, what a way to end (what was at the time) the longest drought for a first time winner. Like I said before, Portugal have really just been meandering at this contest, insistent on establishing their own brand instead of following what was cool and trendy at the time. This explains the fact that before this year, Portugal had NEVER finished in the top 5, despite 53(!) years at this competition, let alone win it. But as they say, if you remain steadfast in your ways, eventually you’ll strike gold, and ***boy*** did they strike gold! Salvador Vilar Braamcamp Sobral, or quite simply Salvador Sobral, who represents a sort of old school vibe with his music, which is quite fitting, since he has a degree in music from a music school in Barcelona. He really didn’t come to prominence until 2016, when he released his first single called “Excuse Me” from his first album. Just one year later, he was competing at the Festival da Canção, a contest in which he would win, with a song called “Amar pelos dios”, which was written and composed by his sister, Luisa Sobral. 
	This song broke many trends at this contest, with the most important belonging to Portugal, as they had the longest winless drought by a country before 2017. Another important trend that was bucked by this song is with language, as this was the song to break English’s stronghold at this contest, with 18 of the last 19 winning songs being performed in that language. But really, this song broke the trend of what could win at ESC, not just with language, It features a backing orchestra, which no other winning song since 1997 had, primarily due to the orchestras being disbanded after ‘97. It’s probably the slowest winning song since the earlier chanson days, but that is exactly why it won. With such slow songs like this one, you really have to make the audience pay attention to it, otherwise you run the risk of boring them, which would tank your score. But instead, this song is such a *vibe*, I can’t really put my finger on what makes it work so well. On the outside, it really is just more of the same for Portugal, with them singing a cultural Portuguese songs in Portuguese, but it’s the ***feel*** of the song, I think, that makes it special. No other song that year or really no other song in a long time really makes you ***feel*** like this one does. It’s such a unique ***tone***, even if the message is one we have heard before (love). But really, it’s the ***way*** the song is delivered, in such a manner only Portugal can replicate, that makes it so special. That’s why we are seeing such a language boom in this contest, because the Sabrals and Portugal showed the rest of Europe the power of embracing your own culture to showcase something incredibly unique and prominent, which other countries have picked up on in recent years. In many ways, “Amar pelos dios” is Eurovision in a nutshell, or should I say, what Eurovision could be, which is a platform to demonstrate one’s talent and one’s country’s unique culture, even if it can be weird at some points. Wow, I did not think I had that much to say about this song, and that’s without saying that this is the first and only song in the post 2016 voting era to be first with ***BOTH*** the juries and televote, demonstrating the sheer power of regionality (or something like that). 
	In other words, what a way to receive your first win, in the most Portugal way possible. 

** This entry is ranked in the ***Top 50*** of all ESC songs since 1975.
*** This goes without saying, but this song received the most points of any song ever at ESC (of course points inflation has a lot to do with it)

How far Eurovision ‘moved’ every year.,1c9f7q9,20,"Buckle up, this is a long one:

So I was wondering, as I do, how far Eurovision ‘moves’ each year - as in, what‘s the distance between host cities each years. So below, I’ve collated the distance between all the host cities every year. Bear in mind, these aren’t exact measurement; they were done on Google earth and isn’t from arena to arena, but from the centre of the cities. Regardless, they’re still a good accurate measuremnt. At the very bottom (sorry for the scroll), I got the average distance ‘moved’ per year, and then found some cities that distance from Malmö. Happy reading!

2023: Turin to Liverpool: 1200km

2024: Liverpool to Malmö: 1060km

*2020’s average: 1585km (Rotterdam to Helsinki)*

The total distance travelled in 67 years is 86,000km (or about double the Equator)

So, the average distance travelled a year is 86,000 divided by 67 (the number of contests), which equals 1290km.

So (based on this maths alone) where could we be going in 2025? Here are some cities that are about 1290km away from Malmö:

Zadar: 1290km 🇭🇷 (although Zagreb would probably host)

Kyiv: 1300km 🇺🇦 (although I don’t think Eurovision could be hosted there 😢)

Belgrade: 1310km 🇷🇸

Florence: 1320km 🇮🇹

Dublin: 1270km 🇮🇪

Lyon: 1230km 🇫🇷

Turin: 1230km 🇮🇹

Milan: 1160km 🇮🇹

Zagreb: 1110km 🇭🇷

Between Croatia and Italy (and France, I suppose), there’s a decent chance that 2025’s host city could be an average distance from Malmö. The wonder of numbers!

Biggest downgrades when an artist switched songs?,1c7xjli,58,"I’m taking about when an artist selected with a specific song - usually at a National Selection -  changes their song afterwards for Eurovision.

For example, Italy 2012, Albania 2015, Malta 2016 & 2022.

Malta 2022 has to be the biggest downgrade for me, they went from a song that might’ve  qualified to a song that would’ve never qualified.",1713535048.0,2024-04-19T23:57:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1c7xjli/biggest_downgrades_when_an_artist_switched_songs/

Some thoughts on the current top 6 contenders (some hot takes incoming),1c59cts,37,"1. Switzerland. I do think this will do better than the last two years, but I'm not convinced this will win. Nemo is a fantastic performer, but as we've seen in Eurovision, popera like this getting to top 5 is the exception, not the norm. Even Italy 2015, the highest scoring popera entry yet, only got 6th with the juries. And like a lot of theatre kids, Nemo can be extra to their own detriment. And given the staging involves roller blades and elbow pads, I have a good feeling they will overdo it to their own detriment. I'm estimating 5th to 10th for this one. It winning will be a net positive since it encourages countries to continue taking musical risks with their entries.
2. Belgium. This one is going to have some hot takes incoming. Of the two dark pop songs we have this year, Belgium is the weaker one. That outro is so repetitive and needs way more lyrics. The climax the song is building to does not hit as hard as it should. Portugal's song has a much harder hitting climax, and Serbia actually hits its peak much more in a much powerful way. It comes off as fan wank to me on every level. It's the kind of song SOME (heavy emphasis on SOME) people listen to because they think it makes them look like they're deep and meaningful. I've heard this kind of song a thousand times before and it's been done better. Austria 2014 is one example that comes to mind. Duffy's Rain on Your Parade also does something like this better, as does Adele's Skyfall. I honestly don't see a world where this wins. If it was a spice, it'd be flour.
   1. Luktelk, the other dark pop song, manages to be catchy without being repetitive, and does actually hit its climax. Granted, Belgium has a more orchestral sound compared to Luktelk's electronic influences. But I think the comparisons do stand. I don't think Belgium will come anywhere close to top 5. I'm predicting this to place 10th to NQ.
3. Italy: I see this one as the most likely to win. Angelina just sells it so perfectly and it manages to be unique while taking influences from Colombia but also being a very contemporary pop song. She is pretty much guaranteed a top 3 result unless she magically screws up or Europe actually is in fact, biased against female Italian singers. I see this winning as a net positive because it just is that good of a song and a more than worthy winner to the Eurovision canon. It's her year to lose, after all.
4. Netherlands. He will almost certainly get a lot of points from continental Western Europe, but I don't see that many points coming in from Eastern Europe and the UK. It's a very Dutch 90s throwback song, and I do think that type of music just appeals to Western Europe for the most part. I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of his points come from Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, but he gets blanked by Eastern Europe and the juries. I don't see this winning, but I do see a wide range of results for him. 3rd to 12th is my prediction.
5. Ukraine. It's an excellent song, even if I think using Mother Teresa as a reference is questionable. Jerry and Alyona have great chemistry together, and I think Alyona's rap is well integrated. Ukraine will almost certainly elevate the NF performance. I think this is guaranteed top 10, and a very likely top 5, but if it wins, I fully expect the backlash from the last Ukrainian win to be worse than before. Granted, I can also see people not wanting to vote for Ukraine because they remember what happened a couple of years ago. I remember how bad the backlash to that win, last year's winner and Toy's win was.
6. Croatia. I'm not surprised this was an album filler song. Seeing as the chorus is kind of generic, and the bridge is just an electronic repeat of the main line. I know it sounds cliche, but this would be better in Croatian since some of the lyrics are super clunky. I still do like the song anyway, because I was into Rammstein as a teenager. I just wish he had revamped it a bit for Eurovision so the chorus could be better, but alas, he put his efforts elsewhere, though in a place equally as important anyway. He has made some incredible improvement as a vocalist, so I'm no longer worried about that. It's just the song that's the big question mark. This will do well with the televote since the song's themes resonate with a lot of diaspora who left home for better opportunities. That's guaranteed. I also could see this doing way better with the juries than expected. If Cha Cha Cha could get top 5 despite those vocals, and if Toy was able to get third, then I could see Croatia actually winning the entire thing. I think he will get top 3, if I'm being honest. It's either him or Italy this year, I don't see any other outcome.
   1. That being said, I do think this song winning will actually get quite a bit of backlash. Both for the legitimate criticisms against it that I've mentioned, but also for xenophobic and fans being way too stan-ish reasons too. I remember how so many didn't like Toy because there were parts that they just didn't connect with or the song was too much for them. But I also remember a lot of antisemitic, fatphobic and misogynist backlash to its victory. I still see people posting in unpopular opinion threads that they think Toy is the worst winner along with Amar Pelos Dois. I can see people doing the same thing here too.
   2. That being said, much like Toy, I will consider its win a net positive since it's guaranteed to open doors for better entrants to come along. I went and listened to Toy for the first time in a long time. I've come to appreciate it a lot more because pulling it off as effortlessly as Netta does is HARD. She is talented, regardless of whether or not you think the song is good.",1713249451.0,2024-04-16T16:37:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1c59cts/some_thoughts_on_the_current_top_6_contenders/
"My Top 37, but I choose to focus on each entry's strenghts. ",1c4v74y,60,"I am not a music professional or educated in music, I just like art and music and Eurovision. My ranking is subjective and we can agree to disagree! Nonetheless, I genuinely like every song in the competition this year so I decided to focus more on the things I like, rather than listing negatives. Hope you enjoy :))



37\. Iceland 🇮🇸 Hera Bjork - Scared of Heights

Hera is such a professional on the stage and her experience really makes her shine and makes this performance such a classic one. Unfortunately it doesn't do much for me as a song, pretty forgettable for my tastes but I can see many people enjoying something that's proven year after year as good and quality entry. A lot of love for Iceland!!


Strengths: High production quality, Hera's confident stage presence.



36\. Israel 🇮🇱 Eden Golan - Hurricane

Eden's voice is really really good and this is a quality ballad. Just truly, doesn't do much for me at all and doesn't do much emotionally for me personally either, as I connect much more to some of the other entries this year. Love to Eden!!


Strengths: Eden's voice.



35\. Denmark 🇩🇰 Saba - Sand

In my opinion, this song could be a contender with utmost potential if only some tiny little tweaks happened. Saba has a wonderful voice and this song has super high production quality, such a class act. Unfortunately, I don't find it memorable enough for a higher ranking, but it's a great song altogether. Saba is very charismatic while performing live. I am hoping that she won't be disappointed by the result because she has so much star power, just maybe could shine more with a better song. ❤️


Strenghts: Saba herself!! 



34\. Czechia 🇨🇿 Aiko - Pedestal

Aiko is a powerhouse, it's a joy to see her performances improving more and more vocally. She's just getting better and better every single time I see her on screen. The song is quite cool, I'd say it's a very modern take on a breakup song that would have a place in Eurovision. I like the lyrics and the story behind this entry too. Unfortunately, I do think the vocals do need to be polished a bit more for this entry to go up on my ranking list, but seeing as this is only pre-show ranking, it could change and go up for me by quite a lot as soon as I watch Aiko's performance on the big ESC stage in Malmo! I love the empowerment that this song brings and I think it's going to appeal to people quite a lot. Also, before yall come at me, no I do not believe that every song requires the vocals in it to shine at all - just Aiko chose quite a vocally dependant and vocally taxing song where I do think it matters more. But if she fully masters it and comes out on top, the reward will be even greater.


Strengths: The empowering message, the lyrics, the chorus. A lot of room for improvement with just a little bit more of vocal practice. Great risk, great reward.



33\. Germany 🇩🇪 Isaak - Always on the run

Isaak has such an unique voice. It is truly a shame that he has been given a song that's probably way too bland for him to show us his full potential. I really like the elephant sound, I like his style of singing and I think it's a good pleasant song to casually listen to, great streaming song actually. It needs a teeny tiny bit more ""flavour"" to stand out in such a jam packed year full of bangers, though. But I truly am wishing Isaak the very best!! 


Strengths: Very inoffensive song, great for Spotify or Youtube casual listening. Radio hit.



32\. Luxembourg 🇱🇺 Tali - Fighter

Tali graced us with such an interesting, catchy girlbop that I can see many people of all kinds vibing to. I love the message that stands for strenght and empowers the listener to fight through obstacles in life, if I am understanding this song right. The vocals have been quite consistently good as well! My biggest issue here is that it can be a little bit forgettable if not for the right staging or performance. I haven't been fully on board with the visual direction of this song, it is a bit underwhelming knowing that Tali could be a warrior princess on a stage. Also, you can see that this song is not something that Tali would usually perform and that it's sort of just made for Eurovision which takes a bit of magic out of it. Nevertheless, very catchy and super likeable. 


Strenghts: Catchy, powerful song with consistently good vocal performances!



31\. Australia 🇦🇺 Electric Fields - One Milkali

I have to admit, some moments of this entry have me melting like a little piece of butter on a hot pan. There's some magic put into this song, that's not up for debate, there's love and tenderness put into it that do hit a good spot. It's a great song! The Yankunytjatjara language is a language we haven't had on Eurovision before, and it's like a cherry on top of this fantastic, heartwarming piece of art. My only issue is, it does sound a bit outdated. The instumental doesn't sound that innovative and even if the lyrics/message/whole vibe is amazing, I am a person who does care a lot about the instrumental. If this was Eurovision 2014 or Eurovision 2015, I would have ranked this definitely in my top 5. 


Strenghts: Uniqueness, very good vibes, amazing lyrics.



30\. Ukraine 🇺🇦 Alyona Alyona & Jerry Heil - Teresa and Maria

I love Jerry's harmonies and Alyona has a pretty good flow. It is overall a great song which I can totally understand being a favorite to win. There is something in this full composition which is slightly missing me, but who knows, I might grow to like it! Ukraine has been one of my favorite ESC countries for years anyway!


Strengths: Very strong and empowering song, Jerry and Alyona are both amazing at what they do. 



29\. France 🇫🇷 Slimane - Mon Amour

Slimane's voice is just out of this world, he is probably one of the best performers I have ever seen. The song isn't something I would usually care for, specifically for this entry, but no one can deny his talent. So even though this is still towards the bottom of my ranking, Slimane gained a new fan. Especially after that DORA performance!


Strenghts: Slimane's voice, Slimane's performance, Slimane!! (I might be crushing on him too).



28\. San Marino 🇸🇲 Megara - 11:11

It is a joy to listen to their song and such a joy watching them perform. Megara always brings a smile to my face! They pull a show no matter what.


Strengths: A banger.



27\. Finland 🇫🇮 Windows95man - No Rules!

This entry just simply makes me happy. I love the positivity in their message. Effortlessly funny and I love love love their personalities so much that it even makes this song better for me.


Strengths: This is pure serotonin.



26\. Armenia 🇦🇲 Ladaniva - Jako

Ladaniva are both such great performers. If they're anywhere near me anytime ever I am getting myself those concert tickets ASAP. Jacquelin's smile is just golden. I have never seen so much charisma in one place. The only thing that I would wish was any different would be that the song could be a bit longer and a tiny bit less repetitive. Otherwise, perfect! ❤️


Strenghts: Infinite charisma points. Their performance will be legendary.



Intermission: !EVERY SONG FROM THIS POINT ON, I HAVE ADDED TO MY PERSONAL SPOTIFY PLAYLIST WHERE I ADD MY FAVORITE MUSIC ONLY!



25\. Poland 🇵🇱 Luna - The Tower

This is such an earworm, such a grower kind of song. Not something I'd usually enjoy but Luna managed to convince me. And oh god she did!! I love the witchy vibes (it's giving me celestial cosmic witch/moon goddess energy and I am here for it!) and love the uniqueness of Luna's voice. Such a cute piece of art right here. I think this is going to be something dominating my Spotify charts months or even years after the contest. 🌙 


Strengths: Catchy and witchy and sublime! Even if you actively tried to, I bet you can't get ""broken bodies scattered through my history; I'm the one who built the tower, I'm the one who holds the power"" out of your head.



24\. Albania 🇦🇱 Besa - Titan

Besa is such a good vocalist, the message is so lovely and Besa just seems like such a lovely person. I've been listening to this quite a lot and perhaps an unpopular opinion, but I am loving the English revamp and I think it was a great choice for this song. 


Strengths: Besa's vocals, a beautiful empowering message, actually super catchy.



23\. Moldova 🇲🇩 Natalia Barbu - In the middle

What a lovely song. Knowing this is a song from a mother to her daughter is beyond lovely. My mommy issues are mommy issuing. The lyrics are so sweet and it touches my soul (I want you to be happy all of your life; my beautiful angel, my work of art 🥺 like cmon!!). Just adorable. I wish Natalia so much luck!! ❤️❤️


Strenghts: Spotless vocals and super wholesome.



22\. Austria 🇦🇹 Kaleen - We will rave

Kaleen is an awesome dancer and the song is literal HYPE and even though she has been struggling vocally a bit I personally don't think that this is the kind of song that relies on vocals a lot - It just makes me want to dance and party regardless. I love the 90s eurodance feel and even though I wasn't even born during those times I do enjoy almost everything inspired by it.


Strengths: Super dancey, great party song, I bet it will do amazing with good staging.



21\. Cyprus 🇨🇾 Silia Kapsis - Liar

I do like a good girlbop and I am not afraid to admit it! 🩷 Silia is such an amazing performer with such a confident stage presence, probably the best dancer in the competition. The song is something I'd consider a summer hit, something I'd listen to if I'm going for a run on a chill summer morning or having cocktails at the beach bar with my friends. Super enjoyable!


Strengths: Silia's performance, song is a great summer banger.



20\. Malta 🇲🇹 Sarah Bonnici - Loop

I think this is underrated. Sarah can dance, Sarah can sing, this is a full show. The song is catchy and it is on LOOP in my brain. I actually love the overacted ""Oh my gawddd you got got got me on-"" cause it adds so much flair to this song. 💅 Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve and Talent served fresh with a side of berries. 


Strenghts: A fantastic performance, catchy, super charismatic. 



19\. United Kingdom 🇬🇧 Olly Alexander - Dizzy

Olly has gone through so much this Eurovision season, and I am feeling very bad for them. Wishing that this unfortunate string of bad luck leaves Olly alone ASAP. ❤️ This song is super underrated, some might write it off as a radio hit that isn't dramatic enough(?) for Eurovision but to be honest I've been listening quite a lot to Dizzy and I don't seem to get tired or bored of it at all. It's cute, it's campy just in the way I like it to be and it's a song that makes me smile day after day. Also, I listened to Years&Years tons as a teen, and huh some things do stay the same through life. 


Strengths: A certified bop, catchy, Olly is an experienced and super talented performer who will totally eat in Malmo. 



18\. Belgium 🇧🇪 Mustii - Before the party is over

Mustii is such an incredible performer that I can turn a blind eye to some vocal difficulties super easily. This song just has it all and there's incredible potential for it to do amazing this year but also stay on our Spotify playlists for a long time after the contest too as something timeless. This is more than a Eurovision spectacle, this is a song that fits all criteria of what a great song is. So much love from me to Belgium this year!❤️❤️


Strenghts: Basically everything about this? Beautifully composed, potential to become an Eurovision classic, Mustii giving us amazing performances time after time.



17\. Portugal 🇵🇹 Iolanda - Grito

Portugal has to be one of my favorite ESC countries. I genuinely think I could listen to the McDonalds menu if it's sang in Portugese with a nice instrumental part added to it. I love love love Portuguese. Some might call French the language of love, but in my taste, Portuguese is just the most beautiful language I've ever heard in music. Iolanda is also one of a kind performer. She has great stage presence and her voice is out of this world. Beautiful song that always gives me goosebumps. I have nothing but awe for this entry. 


Strengths: Iolanda's voice, beautiful ballad that will stand out with such ease this year. Incredible song overall.



16\. Sweden 🇸🇪 Marcus&Martinus - Unforgettable 

I personally think this is super underrated. It's catchy, it's fun, it's dancey, it's honestly a certified banger if I ever knew one. The staging will be fantastic, M&M are so professional yet so fun on stage. Just a great song. Loving everything about this!


Strengths: Don't underestimate the power of a meticulously crafted banger.



15\. Croatia 🇭🇷 Baby Lasagna - Rim Tim Tagi Dim

Now, you've probably seen me on this subreddit simping about Baby Lasagna and raving about how cute his cats are. You might ask yourself, how is this not top 5 or even top 10 for me? Worry not. I genuinely like every single song out of this year. The rankings only mean how much I've listened to them or replayed them on Spotify. This isn't something I would listen to out of ESC or in my spare time in general, but I still adore BL to bits!! ""Meow cat, please meow back"" won over my heart two months ago and it still has my heart. Marko has been improving so much and it's a joy to see. This is one of my winners for the contest and I wholeheartedly agree that Croatia deserves it. I love the message about Balkan people leaving their countries and their homes to find better work and better opportunities in bigger cities or richer countries. So much depth yet presented as something lighthearted that we can just drink and party to. I can get behind that 100%. 


Strenghts: It's impossible to dislike this entry. NEON CATS!!! Baby Lasagna going from being unexperienced to one of the best performers this year. Deep message yet presented as a party song. 



14\. Norway 🇳🇴 Gate - Ulveham 

This is pure magic. The performances are SO POWERFUL. Gunnhild's voice makes me cry. The song is so beautiful. Art in it's genuine form. Speechless. This is absolutely flawless. I also saw one video where Gunnhild describes Ulveham as being a song about ""liberation on your own terms"". I can get behind that! 


Strenghts: .... (I am still speechless so let's just simply say EVERYTHING about this).



13\. Estonia 🇪🇪 5miinust&puulup - Nendest

Ahh, my favorite e-pop group. The day I stop stanning Kohver oppa is the day when you need to be concerned if this is still the real catlxdy, because that would probably be my evil clone. Even though I can't spell or pronounce this song's title, it's been on repeat constantly. Never fails to make me happy or make me want to dance. The lyrics are super clever (even though I am probably missing out on a lot because I am reading the translated version) and the rap parts are super fun and super well done. The talharpa talharping is just the cherry on top. 💙🖤🤍


Strenghts: Unique instrument, a really good rap song, FUN FUN FUN.



12\. Georgia 🇬🇪 Nutsa Buzaladze - Firefighter

Undisputable QUEEN energy. So dominant, so confident. 👑 
Her performances of this entry combined with her truly powerful vocals simply got me speechless. So I will keep it short.


Strenghts: Duh? Do I even need to list them? Just watch any preparty performance by Nutsa and you'll see for yourself. 



11\. Greece 🇬🇷 Marina Satti - Zari

Oh god. If you don't speak Greek, please do me a favour and look up what the lyrics mean. On top of everything, this is so poetic. The bridge of this song is so angelic. Marina's voice is beautiful and she is so incredible and so unique and so talented  and her artistry is something that's like... hats off. No words to describe this. This is the ethnic yet modern yet so so so personal - this isn't something just crafted for Eurovision (not that there's anything wrong with entries like that! - this is something straight out of Marina's soul and spirit and her ancestry. I am incredibly proud of her! And let's not even mention what a banger this is as well! Like woahh!!! 💙🤍🧿 This will be in my Spotify wrapped for sure.


Strenghts: Uniqueness, authenticity, such an ethnic bop, angelic voice, just a beautiful piece of art overall. 



10\. Azerbaijan 🇦🇿 Fahree & Ilkin Dovlatov - Ozunla Apar

This entry is pure hedonism. Words just aren't enough to explain how much I enjoy this. Beautiful, relaxing, reminds me of a warm summer night and exploring a new seaside city in a long summer dress with the love of my life. This is a vacation for my ears. ""Take my heart in your hands, do you have what it takes?🥰""


Strengths: Beautiful, relaxing, almost haunting.



9\. Ireland 🇮🇪 Bambie Thug - Doomsday Blue

I admit, at first I did not get this. I still had a lot of respect for Bambie and their artistry (I always say that they're truly one of a kind and a pioneer of their own genre) but just couldn't get into the song itself. Oh how that has changed... This is so beautiful and so theatrical. ""For your romance I'd beg, steal and borrow"" like that is so beautiful yet pure Charisma Uniqueness Nerve and Talent is served a plenty. And I really love anything theatrical with flair and whimsy. Witchy vibes are always something that's totally up my alley too. So proud of Ireland for this amazing choice, I manifest that this song gets the best result it possibly can, perhaps maybe even a win? 🩷 


Strengths: So much uniqueness, genuinely one of a kind entry. Good vocals, Bambie being perfect every time I see them perform. Bambie being a true artist through and through and a total visionary. 



8\. Latvia 🇱🇻 Dons - Hollow

I love this song. I love Dons. I can't stop listening to this. I genuinely don't know what more to say except that this song slowly but surely has won over my heart? I always cry while listening to it too. I alsoooo might have a bit of a crush on Dons. Yeah, I know, leave me alone! 😆


Strenghts: Amazing, consistent vocals. Heartfelt lyrics that make you think and ponder. If you're an emotional lil bean like me, likely to make you cry. Underrated but perhaps a dark horse?



7\. Switzerland 🇨🇭 Nemo - The Code

This song feels like a very successful musical experiment. A lot of different things that fit perfectly together and Nemo's perfect vocals to top it off. It's catchy, it's wonderful both as a studio version and as a live performance. Seriously, what more to ask for in a 3 minute song? I would be super happy if Nemo takes the win. They certainly deserve it for this beautiful creativity. 


Strengths: Vocals, authenticity, ""one of a kind"" type of entry in every aspect.



6\. Serbia 🇷🇸 Teya Dora - Ramonda

Super biased, yet this whole list is biased as hell. But I've been a Teya Dora fan for ages. She is an exceptional artist who knows music and I feel like I can always trust her to create a song that I will like. Ramonda is a masterpiece. It's so modern and fresh and timeless. It sounds better live than it does in the studio version which is a rarity and one of the highest praises I could give someone personally, as a person who almost always prefers studio versions of stuff.


Strengths: A great ballad with fantastic vocals, a potential for a great staging and Teya Dora herself being a musical sorceress. 



5\. Italy 🇮🇹 Angelina Mango - La Noia

At first, I did not understand the hype behind this entry. Then I decided to give it a shot - watched the live performances and read the translated version of the lyrics. And BOOM TOP FIVE immediately. Angelina is a born artist and performer. She sells the song so well on stage - she becomes it. 
It also takes quite a lot of talent to make such a fun bop out of a song that deals with heavy topics. Funny how a song about boredom didn't bore me in the slightest and instead left me feeling so engaged. Let's go ANGELINA MALMO 🥭!!


Strenghts: Interesting melody, Angelina's stage presence, interesting lyrics, a very very strong contender and I'd be happy seeing this take the win. 



4\. Spain 🇪🇸 Nebulossa - Zorra

What a catchy entry with so much thought behind it. Once I read the lyrics translated to English, I was sold. 
I am also a zorra 🦊 and a black sheep and so many woman can relate to this and let this be our hymn!! 


Strenghts: The empowering lyrics, musically it's such a bop, very interesting staging, catchy!



3\. Netherlands 🇳🇱 Joost Klein - Europapa

My favorite party song of the year. There isn't a thing I don't love about this. Joost is such a sweetheart. He already had me at  Friesenjung so hearing that he will represent NL this year put me in such anticipation. And god I was not disappointed!! His energy is infectious, his enthusiasm is beautiful to see, I love his interviews and basically anything that makes his personality shine. The Amsterdam preparty performance with the shitty graphics was hillarious. I just love this song so much. It gives me such a whiplash in the best way possible - it makes me smile, makes me laugh, makes me want to dance and then always at the ending I am crying. ""It is a world without borders"" is such a wholesome sentiment and I genuinely believe Joost, your father is so very proud of you. It is beautiful to see a person achieving their lifelong dreams and I can feel through the screen how happy he is to be on this contest. Just beautiful.

 
Strenghts: Uniting Europe with singing and dancing together, wholesome message, catchy song, best party song this year in my opinion. And JOOST HIMSELF!! He is amazing and I love him. ❤️ 



2\. Lithuania 🇱🇹 Silvester Belt - Luktelk

This is so cool. Like, effortlessly cool and modern and just a banger. This is something I'd constantly listen to wherever I would ""find"" it, so even if this wasn't an Eurovision entry at all it would be one of my favorite songs even though I do not speak Lithuanian at all. This is just something that I genuinely just like so much. I don't care how this places and if other people appreciate it at all - this is going to stay on my playlists forever. I can vibe to this while I'm out doing whatever, this is a perfect song to party to, to work out to, perfect song to listen to while gaming, while with friends, while singing in the shower. The performance is hypnotic and stays in your brain for a long long time. I haven't heard a song that's more ""in my taste"" on Eurovision in a long time (okay, since 2021 but you get the gist!). I love Silvester so much!! ❤️


Strenghts: Banger, versatile, pure vibes and did I mention that it's a straight up B A N G E R. 



1\. Slovenia 🇸🇮 Raiven - Veronika

My number one in a long list of number ones. The best of the very best. This will be a love letter to ""Veronika"". First of all, I feel simply understood by this song. I feel undestood in the power of my own femininity. Raiven presents this very well in creating an ethereal wonder compressed in a three minute song. Checking out her other music, she seems to know quite a lot about these topics - she is cooking up a whole album full of beautiful songs about women who were judged, wrongfully accused and put down by society. And I feel this with every little bone and every little cell of my body. To understand how meaningful and beautiful this song is, you need to understand years of patriarchal oppression and years of generational trauma. ""Remember, they didn't burn witches, they burned women and girls"" is something even Raiven herself posted on TikTok.  But now it is time to embrace our femininity and be fearless in the faces of ones who still try to opress us. Not just us (women) but anyone who ever has been oppressed. We are beautiful, we are worth to have songs sung about us. We deserve to sing songs who empower us.

Raiven's music is like my own personal Medusa this year. I don't know if you've read the story about Medusa. If you haven't, please do.

I am in love with this entry. So deeply touching. Not to even start going into the other aspects apart from the lyrics and music - this one has it all. Raiven's stage presence is so elegant, so regal and so powerful. Her voice is spotless, absolutely perfect. The ""RAAAH"" is such a great detail. ""I am, you are - Veronika"" and we all do become Veronika in that moment. We feel her pain and we feel her anger. And only she knows our truths. This is just magic. Listening or watching this is an out of this world, fantasy experience. I'm tearing up from even just writing this.



And I usually just always ""like what I like"" when it comes to Eurovision without caring what wins. Because many times I've had my ""own winners"". But if my own winner (Raiven) doesn't even qualify this year, I will be quite sad. This song deserves it all.
Strenghts: Spotless vocals, powerful stage presence, witchy vibes which are my favorite vibes, a beautiful powerful message of empowerment. 10 points from me to Slovenia! 🤍🤍

[u/TrollHunter87](https://www.reddit.com/u/TrollHunter87/) will very kindly be using his automated script to collate these rankings. **Please note that the submission instructions are slightly different as a result of this format including multiple entries from the same country.** If you want to ensure that your vote counts, make sure that:

1. You write both the country and the year in the row (e.g. ""Bulgaria 2017"" or ""🇧🇬  2017"") *OR* write the song title
2. You write the countries in separate lines, and the lines start with a number (example: ""1. United States"")
3. You can't have a tie between songs
4. Don't just put ""1."" at the start of every row and let reddit do its thing. Actually put the all the numbers from 1 to 10 in the markdown
5. If you're unsure, just look at the other comments. Almost all of them are valid.

Ranking the Top Eurovision Song Contest Countries since 1975: The Eastern Europe Romp (#42-#38),1bv1vom,4,"Happy April! We are just over one month away from the big day in Sweden as we continue our countdown of the best preforming ESC countries since the mid 70's. This time we focus our attention on Eastern Europe, with all five countries coming from this region. These five give us a treat, as we finally land on a winner in this countdown! Along with that comes with some iconic entries, as we are really ramping up now!

## The Countries

| Placement | Country                | Score      |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ---------- |  
| 38	    | Lithuania              | 52672.429  |
| 39	    | Yugoslavia             | 51841.658  |
| 40	    | Serbia and Montenegro  | 38085.817  |
| 41	    | Slovenia               | 35376.481  |
| 42	    | Czechia                | 34949.934  | 

This batch of five is very interesting. Coming up at #42 is a country on the rise at ESC in Czechia, who have put up some great entries in the past decade. In front of them is a country that have changed their identity at the competition in Slovenia, sending in purely Slovene songs for the past six years. And then there is the big outlier, Serbia and Montenegro, who probably have the highest point to participation ratio at the contest, scoring big having only competed two times. Above S&M is the country they used to be a part of, Yugoslavia, whose existence as a country was always in turmoil to the very end, but towards the tail end of their stint were able to pick up their one and only win, and to this day represent one of two Baltic winners at the ESC. And at #38 is another country on the rise at ESC in Lithuania, who like Czechia have gained some consistent results, with their top entry solidifying themselves in Eurovision lore. 

Some Notable Artists: 


## Worst Entries

### Lithuania | 1994 | [Ovidijus Vyšniauskas - Lopšinė mylimai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0IQPOuN2Pk)
***Contest Ranking***: 25th (0 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 25th (-2.4)

The first entry that we will be looking at today would set many feats for Lithuania. First, it would be their first ever try at ESC, coming in the single largest expansion of the contest since the beginning. Second, it would be preformed by Ovidijus Vyšniauskas, called the Lithuanian ""Joe Cocker"", who would go on to release several hits that would be sung by popular Lithuanian musicians. Third, this song would be sung in Lithuanian, a first for the contest and to this day the first of only three* times it would be fully** used. Fourth, it would go on to join ESC infamy, not gaining a single point on the night in Dublin, only one of about 40 songs to do so. Fifth, this result was so bad that the country wouldn't return until 1999, even though they were only relegated for a single year. 

*2024's entry will be sung in Lithuanian
**2001's entry has lyrics in Lithuanian, so I said fully to distinguish the two. 

### Czechia | 2009 | [Gipsy.cz - Aven Romale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3CgUmzl4sk)
***Contest Ranking***: DNQ (18th 1st Semifinal)  
***My Ranking***: 42nd (-2)

Would you look at that, another one for the zero point club! Yeah Czechia's start to ESC was not the most pretty, not qualifying with any of their first three attempts, while gaining scores of one (1), nine (9), and zero (0) in the process. This mantel would be held by Gipsy.cz, a Czech Romanai group known for their pop, rap, hip-hop, and traditional Roma music. The group already tried to represent the country twice in the prior two years, but were denied twice at the national final. They finally triumphed in 2009, as they were internally selected to compete alongside their song, Aven Romale. I didn't know what to expect but this song is actually fun! Radoslav ""Gipsy"" Banga was the highlight, wearing a red costume with a crest in the middle. The song feels like one that would be sung at a musical, sort of like a character origin story, but it has a charm like that. It's a shame that no one thought the same, and it's even more of a shame that this song would be it for Czechia until 2015.

### Slovenia | 2004 | [Platin - Stay Forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gh2F0aufEw)
***Contest Ranking***: DNQ (21st Semifinal)  
***My Ranking***: 35th (.407)

Keeping the NQ's rolling, here is an entry from Slovenia in the 2000's. Here is the Slovenian duo Platin, who have more of a happy story than this entry. There isn't much about them, but they did win the national final (EMA 2004), they did go to Istanbul to preform at ESC 2004, and they did place in the first official ESC semifinal. That's really all I got. Besides from Lečnik and Gomilšek's goat-y vocals (reminds me of Shakira), the song isn't all that memorable, finishing near last in that semifinal. This would kick off a three year NQ streak for Slovenia, and the country would never qualify to the Grand Finals three years in a row after this flop. On the bright side, the couple would get married a day later, with Sertab Erener(!) in attendance!

### Yugoslavia | 1991 | [Baby Doll - Brazil (Бразил)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu3hs-C0ofA)
***Contest Ranking***: 21st (1 pt)  
***My Ranking***: 21st (.48)

It's a bit ironic that the worst preforming song in the ESC history of Yugoslavia would be their last one with all of the countries still together. Tensions were already at a high when the country chose their song for ESC '91, as the winning entry from their national final, ""Brazil"" by Baby Doll aka Dragana Šarić, was selected. Croatia and Slovenia, who gave no points to the Serbian born performer, would split just weeks after Baby Doll's entry, setting the tumultuous scene for the 90's in the Balkans. But in the middle of all of that is a song that is remembered for its trashiness and its background dancers, especially the one with a purple ""Brazil"" shirt. This entry actually put a halt to recent good placements for Yugoslavia, as they were doing consistently well for 4 prior years, which includes an ESC win in '89. I didn't even think this song is that bad, as the beat and vibes are nice, it's really just the singing that falls flat. But is that singing ""just getting 1 point from Malta"" flat? I don't think so, but tell that to the juries. 

### Serbia and Montenegro | 2005 | [No Name - Zauvijek moja (Заувијек моја)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlG7_9-VPw0)
***Contest Ranking***: 7th (137 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 8th (190.007)

Their second attempt wasn't as good as the first, but it was still pretty good! Serbia and Montenegro's ESC time was short, as only two entries made it to the Eurovision stage, but they sure were memorable! This entry was only the third time a Montenegrin performer would take the stage at ESC, with the band No Name winning the right to represent the Balkan country in Kyiv. This song is a balkan ballad done right, especially with the drums blaring in the background as the two lead vocalists, Marko Prentić and Danijel Alibabić harmonize pretty well. And for once, I don't have to talk about how poorly an act did, as their song and unique staging earned them ***douze points*** from Austria, Croatia, and Switzerland en route to 137 points and a top ten placement. No Name would go on to be in some controversy, as their 2006 entry for the country would be withdrawn due to allegations of tacical voting during the national final, and Serbia and Montenegro would split in 2007 into the countries you know of today. Because of how unique the situation was with Serbia and Montenegro, you'll probably never see another highly touted performance in the Worst Section, which really does showcase how much of an outlier S&M were in their short time. 

## Best Years

### Slovenia | 1995 | [Darja Švajger - Prisluhni mi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqM3mAfztU8)
***Contest Ranking***: 7th (84 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 5th (147.418)

Starting off this Best Years list with Slovenia's second ever entry in Eurovision, called ""Prisluhni mi"", preformed by Darja Švajger, who is perhaps one of the most popular Slovene singers ever. By 1995, she would have released 2 albums and would have tried to compete in this competition twice, with the first one being in 1993, where she finished second in Slovenia's preselection show. When she got the chance to compete in the grand final in 1995, her song was considered to be one of the favorites to win it all that year, alongside Norway's entry ""Nocturne"", whose musical melodies were the one to take the grand prize. So this placement/song might be seen as a disappointment considering the expectations, but I don't think anyone would say that after listening to it. 

This song is pretty beautiful, as this power ballad is sung very well by Darja. It reminds me of Poland's entry a year earlier, which was also a power ballad sung by a woman. With power ballads, they typically have one job, and that is to make you appreciate the singer's voice, which I think this song does to a tee. I personally don't see this song as a winner, but considering that this is Slovenia's best placement (tied with 2001), I would take this to be a win for the nation! Darja would get other honors for her preformance that night, as this song would win ""Song of The Year"" in her home country. It would also place high in the charts in several countries, so at the end of the day, who was the real winner that night in Dublin? (It was still Norway)

### Yugoslavia | 1989 | [Riva - Rock Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1glDWFMK_0)
***Contest Ranking***: **1st** (137 pts)  
***My Ranking***: **1st** (269.265)

And now we turn to our first winning entry, from a country that has a mixed history at the competition. Yugoslavia would first start competing in 1961, but they were seen as the outsiders of the competition, due to them being the only Eastern European country until Turkey joined in 1975. Their entries were more of an afterthought, as they only were in the top 5 once before 1980. That all changed with 1983, as ""Džuli"" (Џули), by Daniel got them their best points* total (125) and joint top finish of 4th. This would all culminate in a late 80's run, when the country was on the path of splitting up was when Yugoslavia put up five straight top seven finishes, including a win(!) thanks to Riva, a Croatian rock band that formed in 1986. Consisting of vocalist Emilija Kokić, Dalibor Musap, Nenad Nakić, Zvonimir Zrilić, Boško Colić and Aleksandra Kalafatović, the band would get their chance to showcase themselves as they got the right to preform in Lausanne, Switzerland for ESC '89. 

This song is one of the forgotten winners of ESC, primarily because ESC '89 was a forgettable year in the contest. It doesn't help that three iconic shows ('88, '90, '91) surrounded this one, which is a shame since the voting actually was fairly close** between the top four of Yugoslavia, the UK, Denmark and Sweden. The song is fairly good as well, as I think it hits a good balance of being upbeat while being in control and not boring. Do I think it deserves to win? I think so. I don't know if any of the other three had good enough performances to justify taking this one away from Yugoslavia. And what a time to win it! The band would not reprise their song in 1990, and would split up when their country was, in 1991. This song oddly enough marks the end of an era, as the 90's would feel the ripple effects of '89's winner's collapse and the death of the Soviet Union, so in a way this song fits in to an odd place within the ESC history book. But this song does provide history for Croatia, as because it was the place of the birth of Riva, it would be Croatia to host Yugoslavia's ESC in 1990, the only time the country (Yugoslavia and Croatia) they would get the opportunity. This year Croatia has one of the highest odds to win the whole contest, so maybe this entry in a month's time will cease to be Croatia's best export to Eurovision (by ranking). 


* Context does have to be applied here. There were only like 7 years previously where they could have achieved a high points score like that one.  


** Well not really. Yugoslavia ran away with the voting early but were starting to be caught up with by the end, with the other countries really running out of time there. If you were to play the voting sequence in reverse, you would be in for a treat, as Yugoslavia would be the ones to overtake the UK at the very end. 



### Lithuania | 2006 | [LT United - We Are the Winners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBAdOlQPbwg)
***Contest Ranking***: 6th (162 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 6th (304.551)

And now for one of the most iconic joke entries of all time, which is ironically their country's best placing to this day, despite some recent efforts. After not receieving a single point in '94, Lithuania would not compete again until '99, in which they would actually get some points (13), and a better placing (20). Two more entries would get them modest results until the semifinal was created in 2004, which resulted in two DNQ's in consecutive years. Then came LT United, a group who formed for the sole purpose of being in Eurovision. Led by six well known people in Lithuania, including one who had already participated in the contest in 2001 for the country. The group would completely sweep their national final, earning double the amount of second place to gain the right to represent in Athens '06. Prior to the contest, LT United refused to preform their song, requesting it to be pulled from radios and public airplay until after the Final. This song had its supporters and haters, with some seeing the song as ""egotistical"" and annoying. This would lead to some booing at their performance in the semifinals & Grand Final. 

Now a song telling you that they are the winners of Eurovision before the end of the competition, along with lyrics about being heard everywhere, and to vote for them because they have already won, might rub some people the wrong way. Unfortunately I think some people might have missed the joke of the song, or thought that it was done in poor taste (that would be Iceland's entry from the same year). This song is fun, first and foremost, as it really is just a good time for around three minutes. That includes the infamous megaphone, and the even more infamous guitar solo, which includes one of the members dancing intensely to the beat. This entry may have been polarizing in the hall, most people outside of it liked the charm of the song, which gave them big points, especially from the UK and Ireland, who may have been inspired by LT United with some of their entries in the coming years. Finishing 6th with a song that earned boos in the hall is an impressive feat, that's usually Russia's job for some years. What's even more incredible than this is that to this day this is Lithuania's best preforming entry, doing 50 pts better than The Roop's performance in 2021. For a country that took a while to figure out what works for them at ESC, sending in something like this was a bold move, but it managed to pay off in many dividends. 



### Czechia | 2018 | [Mikolas Josef - Lie to Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLGfxc3eTNw)
***Contest Ranking***: 6th (281 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 6th (361.559*)

Czechia's second stint at ESC has gone a lot better than its first. After not qualifying in their first year back (2015), they would go on to qualify for the Grand Final for the first time in 2016, and they would acheive their first top ten and best placing two years later in Lisbon, thanks to Mikolas Josef. Mikolas has had a fruitful carrer before ESC, as he comes from a family of musicians but focused more on modeling for international brands like Prada and Diesel. He cut his modeling carrer short however, as he did not agree with the practices in the buisness. He then turned to music, as he traveled all over Europe, trying to earn enough money to make a music video for his single ""Hands Bloody"" (him trying to wash his hands of the modeling industry). His second single, called ""Free"", would be more popular however, as that song would be the 4th played song in his home country. After recording another single, he would move to Vienna, where he would work with muti-award winning  sound producer Nikodem Milewski. That work would culminate in the song ""Lie To Me"", which would win the Czech national final, and Mikolas would go from modeling to Eurovision (specifcally Lisbon). 

""Lie To Me"" is an interesting song. Mikolas was already approached to participate for his country with the song ""My Turn"", which he declined, and would be preformed by Martina Bárta. He rejected the song because he thought it wasn't his style, in favor for a song a little more his speed. That is ***certainly*** the case with this one. ""My Turn"" is more of a ballad than anything, very slow and methodical, while this song is a lot more upbeat, groovy, and danceable, which were all showcased by a memorable performance by Mr. Josef. It was one of the more notable stagings of the night, complete with Fortnite dancing, backpack slinging, and really a more lively tone than many other Czech performances in the past. This would help them cruise into the final, finishing 3rd in the 1st semifinal. On the night, it would finish 6th, by far Czechia's best placing (their next highest at the time was 25th). Mikolas would make a name for himself that night in Portugal, as the song is the most streamed Czech entry, which would lead to him making his own label, where he would release his first album, called ""One"", earlier this year. 


* This song is ranked ***87th*** of all songs since 1975. And because I forgot to add this to their entry, North Macedonia 2019 is ranked ***59th*** of all songs since 1975.    


### Serbia and Montenegro | 2004 | [Željko Joksimović and Ad-Hoc Orchestra - Lane moje (Лане моје)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7OvpjplJ_8)
***Contest Ranking***: 2nd (263 pts)  
***My Ranking***: 2nd (607.406**)

Serbia and Montenegro came from the ashes of a crumbling state in Yugoslavia. This country used to be named FR Yugoslavia, and competed at ESC in 1992, but were subsequently banned from any form of competition until 2002, when sanctions were lifted after a messy decade long war raged through the Balkans. They couldn't take part in ESC 2003 due to too many countries, but they would get the chance to compete in 2004, and boy did they come in with a bang! Enter probably the most influential Balkan representative in Eurovision ever, in Željko Joksimović. Where to start with him! At 12, he would win the First Accordion of Europe Award at a music festival in Paris. He would graduate from the oldest university in Serbia, from there he would then launch his staggering musical career. He would achieve great success as by 2000, including a number 1 hit in Serbia, an award at the International Festival of Arts, and compositions for several theatre productions. Everything would change once he competed for the right to represent his country at ESC in 2004, winning that honor at  Evropesma 2004, a music festival for Serbia and Montenegro. 

This song is an all timer. It is one of the few ESC songs in the language rule-less era pre 2012 to transcend the language barrier in such a beautiful way while showcasing the best of that country's language. It's pure poetry in motion as this song focuses a lot on its buildup, which is tricky to do when you are only limited to three minutes per song. But it manages to to both build up the song while making the payoff worth it, as all the sections after in the song are so beautiful. This song is beautiful, simply put, whether its the flute melody, the violin solo, or his voice, which is also incredible. There really isn't anything I could point to and say that it is objectively bad, because there are no weak spots in this song. It does what many ESC winners do, which is hold your attention while telling its own story, which for this entry is about the age old ESC staple of love, or more specifically, getting over a love, trying to make sure he can't love his sweetheart anymore. After listening to this song, I can see why every participating country gave Željko points, and why he would get an award for Best Composer. What is the only shame about this song is that it would be the first song in ESC history to not win when scoring 200+ points (the second being Greece's entry from the same year), falling just short of Ruslana and Ukraine that night in Turkey.

Things couldn't have gone better for Željko after ESC 2004, as he would go on to compose Bosnia and Herzegovina's best preforming entry in 2006, win ***another*** contest in 2007, host ESC 2008 in Serbia after ""Molitva"", which many people say has inspiration in Željko's brand of music, won in 2007, compose a song that would preform in that year's contest (Greece 2008) and finish 6th, represent Serbia in Baku in 2012, finish 3rd in that competition, and then compose Montenegro's best preforming song in 2015. Not to mention that he would marry his cohost for the contest in 2008, Jovanna Janković, in 2012. The influence of Željko Joksimović in Eurovision for not only his country but for future Balkan entries cannot be said enough, as he changed everything for his region with his fateful performance in 2004. 

** This song is one of the Top 50 ESC entries since 1975. 


## Final Thoughts

Which one of these songs is your favorite (Lane moje is mine)? Do you think that the countries that still are competing will surpass their record (I think all three are on the up and up, so they will eventually)? Do you think Serbia and Montenegro should be this high (I know they are a big outlier, but I think that this is an appropriate place for them)?",1712172805.0,2024-04-04T05:33:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1bv1vom/ranking_the_top_eurovision_song_contest_countries/

Will try to update these every now and then in order to track the changes throughout the season, and if there's anything you'd like to see in the data next time, let me know and I'll see what I can do.

🎵The Throwback Thursday Supervote🎵 - Liverpool 2023 Results & Semi-Finals Introduction,1btuwfz,32,"After eleven trips down memory line, we have finally completed the first round of the **Throwback Thursday Supervote**, this year's special vote on every Eurovision song from Malmö 2013 to Malmö 2024. Last week we voted on the most recent edition, [Liverpool 2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1bpssab/the_throwback_thursday_supervote_heat_eleven/) \- in the busyness of the week we had a slightly reduced number of participants as **125** community members submitted valid rankings. After transforming these rankings into sets of Eurovision-style votes, the top 8 songs with the highest points have qualified for the semi-finals in April. Again, the fight for the last qualification spot was very close!

The **eight qualifiers from 2023** are, in alphabetical order:

* 🇦🇺  **Australia:** Voyager - ['Promise'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSoy_mJMlMY&list=PLRIS7dI_vQcjGOdoXqCuKSyD8WjLxDDAF&index=15)
* 🇦🇹  **Austria:** Teya and Salena - ['Who the Hell is Edgar?'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uk64V9h0Ko&list=PLRIS7dI_vQcjGOdoXqCuKSyD8WjLxDDAF&index=1)
* 🇨🇿  **Czechia:** Vesna - ['My Sister's Crown'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nuypbLMfNQ&list=PLRIS7dI_vQcjGOdoXqCuKSyD8WjLxDDAF&index=14)
* 🇫🇮  **Finland:** Käärijä - ['Cha Cha Cha'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6rS8Dv5g-8&list=PLRIS7dI_vQcjGOdoXqCuKSyD8WjLxDDAF&index=13)
* 🇱🇻  **Latvia:** Sudden Lights - ['Aijā'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEykwl9X9SY&list=PLRIS7dI_vQcjGOdoXqCuKSyD8WjLxDDAF&index=28)
* 🇳🇴  **Norway:** Alessandra Mele - ['Queen of Kings'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUHSM_vTqTI&list=PLRIS7dI_vQcjGOdoXqCuKSyD8WjLxDDAF&index=20)
* 🇸🇮  **Slovenia:** Joker Out - ['Carpe Diem'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LXlPviGiWc&list=PLRIS7dI_vQcjGOdoXqCuKSyD8WjLxDDAF&index=24)
* 🇸🇪  **Sweden:** Loreen - ['Tattoo'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BE2Fj0W4jP4&list=PLRIS7dI_vQcjGOdoXqCuKSyD8WjLxDDAF&index=9)

The rest of the results are as follows, compiled in a simple table:

Spain missing out is the biggest surprise of this entire vote for me so far!

And thus, the **first round is now complete, and we move on to...**

# The Semi-finals

**96 songs remain in contention.** These songs have been drawn semi-randomly into **three semi-finals of 32 songs,** and within that drawn into three thirds, from which I have arranged running orders. As in the first round, **the top 8 of each semi-final will qualify for the grand final.** In addition, the 9th placed song with the highest number of votes will receive a **wildcard** to complete the final 25.

Here are the full semi-final line-ups:

Your Favorite Eurovision Stages,1bs33vb,14,"The songs may be what most remember in Eurovision, but the stage design has been different every single year. Here are a couple of my favorites.

**1973**  
In my opinion, what sets this stage apart from all of the others are the choice of light and color. In the modern day, and even in the years this one is wedged between, were used to dark rooms with a bit of light coming from the stage. In this year, not only does it seem like all the lights are on. They gave the entire stage a white marble coloring which really makes it stand out among others. Furthermore, Having the orchestra circling the back of the stage, looking like a jury in a courtroom is a really interesting idea

**1986**  
This year was mediocre, but the stage was truly something else. They really embraced this being the northernmost eurovision venue in history. Giving the entire stage a winter wonderland. The choice a lot of performers made to wear white on this stage made it even more beautiful.

**1991**  
Oh my god, I love this so much. Having the stage be based around geographical locations may have also been done in 1994, but what makes this one stand out more to me was the background giving a pop art aesthetic. Kinda like what you would see in comic books or 60s England. Probably my favorite stage of all time

**1992**  
I'm a sucker for themed stages, and this is a goddang Viking ship. Need I say more?

**1999**  
I am VERY impressed by what Jerusalem pulled off in 1999. The stage was massive, they had a giant zodiac calendar(?) in the background, and did I forget to mention this behemoth MOVES? That had to have been expensive! 

**2000**  
One of the simpler stages, but I enjoyed it. The lips showing a warped image of the performing countries flag is cool, and a concept I wish they brought back once or twice since then. And those five portable screens were something that had never been seen in the contest at the time. And they really stood out. Especially with Austrias entry

**2009**  
I'll be real. Since 2003, most of the stages have felt kinda samey. Some random shape for the main stage. Usually, a circle or oval. Add an appendix to it for the singer to walk across during the climax of their song. Install LED screens over the entire back wall, and boom. Modern Eurovision stage. It's been hard to find stages in the last 20 years that stand out enough from the generations surrounding it. 2009 is one of those stages. The entire thing was something well likely never see in eurovision again. One third of the worlds LED screens at the time were in that venue that week. And the performers were able to turn their songs into an art show. Like a live music video.

So that's been my favorite stages in the contest. I may have missed some, since as of right now, I've only watched up to 2015. I'd love to hear what stage designs you liked the most.",1711864051.0,2024-03-31T15:47:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1bs33vb/your_favorite_eurovision_stages/
Possible Throwback Thursday Subreddit Activity Idea: Community Watch-alongs,1bnhmsc,8,"As someone who only joined the Eurovision fandom after watching the ESC2023 ggrand final, while the upcoming contest is very exciting, I'm admittedly finding the period between the national finals and the semi finals a little dull. As well as this, I feel that a lot of non-winning songs from pre-2015 contests sadly get forgotten. These two issues led me to think of a possible (and admittedly messy) solution: Community Watch-alongs!

&#x200B;

Basically, what I mean by this is that, on Throwback Thursdays, possibly starting at about 5pm CET/4pm GMT, we (the Subreddit) all watch an old Eurovision final, possibly starting at about 2004 (although this can be made earlier or later). This could not only give community members something fun to do, but also allows discussion about older songs and years. There a few ways that we can do this:

a)  Just watch the grand final.

b)  Watch semi 1 on Tuesday and semi 2 on Thursday (If the year is post-2008, just watch the one semi on Wednesday).

c)  Watch both semis on one day.

&#x200B;

However, one of my biggest concerns about this idea is coordination since it most likely will be at least a little challenging to get everyone interested in the watch-along to be able to watch the show at the same time considering that, on Youtube, certain people will get ads at different lengths at different times, as well as it being a bit hard for those joining late to catch-up. Both of these issues may make it hard for viewers to discuss songs and understand where everyone is. A possible solution to the second problem is programming a bot to label what time stamp the watcg-along is at, but this will most likely be difficult.

&#x200B;

If this idea seems impractical, confusing or unnecessary, I'm fine with it not being implemented. I just wanted to give a suggestion since I quite like Throwback Thursdays. :)",1711383337.0,2024-03-26T02:15:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1bnhmsc/possible_throwback_thursday_subreddit_activity/
I spent 5 hours listening to and ranking every song Germany has sent to Eurovision,1bn58ws,69,"I'm moving to Germany in one month and won't be able to vote for them anymore so I decided to instead write a list ranking every song they've sent to the contest, including the single year they didn't qualify for the final.

I'm curious if anyone else has done this or just me XD like not just with Germany but with another country - I guess it would be easier for a country like Australia or Ukraine who hasn't been participating as much.

TMDL (too much, didn't listen); if you haven't heard the songs, you NEED to hear ""Im Wartesaal zum großen Glück"" (1956) - it's a really really good song that tells a story about good luck and a ship and is probably the best Eurovision song I've heard to date. ""Miss Kiss Kiss Bang"" (2009) was highly underrated, as was ""Blood and Glitter"" (2023). I ranked ""Satellite"" (winner in 2010) in the top 10, but the first winner, ""Ein bisschen Frieden,"" is very low. I find some of the lowest-ranking German songs sound like German folk - which I have never been a fan of - or Schlager.  ""Dschinghis Khan"" (1979), ""Wadde Hadde Dudde Da?"" (2000), and ""Guildo hat euch lieb"" (1998) are the best meme songs that are actually bops. I listed ""Always on the Run"" at number 9.

Ranking the Top 52 Eurovision Song Contest Countries since 1975: The First Five,1bjh4lj,6,"Good evening! As ESC 2024 in Malmö comes nearer, I wanted to do something to celebrate the last 50(ish) years of this wonderful show! I decided to rank all 1400+ songs in this time period with a formula that I made, which culminated into a score for all 52 countries that have competed since 1975. I initally wanted to post a thread for every single country, but those posts were removed since it would be seen as ""spammy"". So in order to (hopefully) circumvent this, I will post a handful of countries at a time in order from #52 to #1, which will not only mean less posts, but give a little bit of flair in the run up towards the Grand Final. Besides, we get to pass the remaining sub 50 days with a fun countdown! 

## How it Works
Like mentioned before, I made a simple formula to give a value to every song from 1975-2023. Basically, the more points and countries that vote for that song, the better. Those points are all accumulated together for every country, and then are ranked from 52 to 1. 

## Why start from 1975? 
Well I initially wanted to start from 1974 (for ABBA and all), but since from 1975 and on ESC has used the ""douze points"" system, I thought it would be better than to start from there. 

## How will this be posted? 
Well, I don't want to say how frequent these posts will be, but they won't be posted every day (that's for the mods). I will have the final post before the first show in May.

Ok, so here we go, I present to you the First Five ESC countries by performance! 

```
| Placement | Country      | Score    |
| --------- | ------------ | -------- |
| 48        | San Marino   | 3925.18  |
| 49        | Montenegro   | 2861.327 |
| 50        | Slovakia     | 1686.341 |
| 51        | Andorra      | 302.414  |
| 52        | Morocco      | 183.552  |
```
Notable Artists: Anonymous (Andorra), Samira Bensaïd (Morocco), Sergej Ćetković (Montenegro), Susanne Georgi (Andorra), Knez (Montenegro), Valentina Monetta (San Marino), Marcel Palonder (Slovakia), Senhit (San Marino), Serhat (San Marino), Tublatanka (Slovakia), Twiins (Slovakia), Marian van de Wal (Andorra)

## Worst Years
This section will be dedicated to the worst entry for each of these nations. Starting from the bottom.

### San Marino | 2017 | Valentina Monetta and Jimmie Wilson | [Spirit of the Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXiQr2ew3lQ&ab_channel=EurovisionSongContest)
**Contest Ranking**: DNQ (18th 2nd Semifinal)
**My rankings**: 42nd (-2.201)

So San Marino have not had much of a good time points wise at this contest, as they have only participated in the Grand Final 3 times out of 14 possible entries (13 if you take Covid into account). In fact they have recorded scores of five (5), one (1), and zero (0) in these semifinal appearences, which really tells you the struggling story of poor San Marino. Now you can argue that it should be their 2023 entry here as it has the lower score, but because of the sizes of the semifinals they competed in (2017 has 18 while 2023 has 17), and the fact that 2023 was televote only while 2017 had both the juries and televote, this one edges it out according to my formula, preformed by San Marino Queen Valentina Monetta alongside... [German Barack Obama???](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmie_Wilson_(singer)). This was the singers' 4th(!) and 1st entries for the country respectively, and well, I think Monetta's other songs were better. This one is a decent club track, but outside of that, this song kinda fades away into the background, like any good club track. At least Germany (1) appreciated it...

### Andorra | 2006 | [Jenny - Sense Tu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UffvRSmRYEk&ab_channel=EurovisionSongContest)
**Contest Ranking**: DNQ (23th Semifinal)
**My rankings**: 36th (0.401)

First of all, let me preface this by saying that I appreciate that all of Andorra's singers sing (at least partly) in Catalan! I think that it is pretty cool that these countries show off their pride and culture on an international stage. And a bigger plus is that it ***can*** make an entry unique, which is a very crucial element to preforming well at a singing competition! Now saying this, this song, preformed by Jennifer ""Jenny"" Serrano, left me a bit... confused on its meaning. Apparently this song is meant to be a dramatic rock ballad, which is definably noticeable if not for the staging, which has Jenny, dressed in all black, surrounded by 4... sexy ballerinas in white clothing? And then there's a single lady in the background giving backing vocals, trying her best to sell the sexy dark vibe of the song. I just couldn't make sense of it all, and neither did the majority of Europe, as Andorra had to rely on their good ole neighbors Spain to make sure they didn't join the ESC Hall of ***nul points***.

### Slovakia | 2009 | [Kamil Mikulčík and Nela Pocisková - Leť tmou](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLMU1u2ojfk&ab_channel=Jannu)
**Contest Ranking**: DNQ (18th 2nd Semifinal)
**My rankings**: 37th (0.766)

I find it kind of funny that Slovakia's worst performing song was their first entry since first withdrawing in 1999. But yes, after announcing that they would return to ESC in 2008, Slovak broadcaster Slovenská televízia (STV) went to work choosing which representative would go to Moscow in 2009. 50 songs would compete in that year's national final, and at the end of the process, it would be this ballad that would prevail and go on to the main event. The song itself is fine enough in my opinion, as it features some impressive high notes from Mrs. Pocisková (extra points for the song being sung in Slovak), and the pair do complement each other well. It feels like something that would fit best as background music at a fancy ball, which is dandy and all, but not something that would translate well to Eurovision at that current time (ethnic bops and flashy choreography/staging). So this song, like all of the other Slovak entries, would fall to the wayside, finishing a dismal 18th in the second semifinal, and 37th out of 42 countries in my rankings. 

### Montenegro | 2012 | [Rambo Amadeus - Euro Neuro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHnqF5PLP2w&ab_channel=EurovisionSongContest)
**Contest Ranking**: DNQ (15th 1st Semifinal)
**My rankings**: 41st (1.109)

This one is a very interesting case of ESC/Euro politics at work, mostly in the form of satire! These type of songs have two outcomes, you can be like Lithuania in 2007  telling everyone that they have already won, or you can be like Ireland just one year later, and there is no in-between. This one falls towards the latter as this song by noted ""media manipulator"" Rambo Amadeus (real name Antonije Pušić) comments on the relationship between his country and the EU. In particular, he talks about the Euro debt crisis, which plagued Europe for a lot of the 2010's. He also talks about the children, and he uses a lot of words that end in -ism, -tic, and -ion. For real though, it's a pretty poignant song about the mess of the financial crisis (look up where the Euro Neuro comes from), that unfortunately was treated as the worst thing that was ever heard (which includes quotes like ""This is seriously one of the worst songs I’ve heard at Eurovision in a long time. I’m all about making things deep, but I don’t need my ears to bleed in the process.""), and finished 15th in the 1st semi. It's a shame, because this song kind of grows on you after awhile. (It's pretty satisfying singing the verses of the song). 

###  Morocco | 1980 | [Samira Bensaid - Bitakat Hob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97FD34DpSuw&ab_channel=escLIVEmusic1)
**Contest Ranking**: 18th
**My rankings**: 18th (3.824)

For Morocco, they only have this song in 1980 from future Arabic superstar Samira Bensaid. So that means this is also their best song, as well as their worst. To keep it brief, I was sad that this song got so low! This song has a terrfic blend of Arab and disco, which was honestly a breath of fresh air considering the ballad heavy era of the contest. This also means that this was the first song to be sung in Arabic! For the rest of this review, let me copy what I was gonna say for this song. ***"" It feels really modern, especially since This makes it all the more a shame that only the Italian juries appreciated this message of love, only receiving 7 points on the night. (It could be worse, this song did just as well as Portugal's first three entries combined).*** Unfortunately for fans of Morocco, or for any Arab nation, this might be the only song from the region you'll ever hear at ESC, considering the main reason for these country's non participation lies with Israel. 

## Best Entries
Now for the best that these countries have to offer! Unfortunately, for most of the countries on here, it would be the best that they will ever give (for now). 


### Andorra | 2007 | [Anonymous - Salvem el món](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcbefpUPuLA&ab_channel=EurovisionSongContest)
**Contest Ranking**: DNQ (12th Semifinal)
**My rankings**: 24th (2.159)

And here for Andorra, the entry that got the closest from escaping semifinal hell. Here is the band Anonymous, the only male act that Armenia have sent to ESC. Like with 2008 (and with 2006), this one was internally selected, but this time there was an open application for any Andorran adult to submit themselves. Out of the selection came the punk rock band, consisting of members Guillem Gallego, Niki Francesca and Alejandro Martínez. And with them came a new sense of energy for Andorra! This song is unlike many of their previous (and future) entries, and it's all in good ways! I've seen many people likening them to bands like ***Green Day***, and after listening to their song, I completely agree, both in style and with their song! Their staging seems simple, but for the act it fits near perfectly, as it really makes them stand out in a positive manner (I love the arrow keys showing behind them). It also helps when the song is very catchy (I can't stop saying ""left, right, up and down""). The message of their song is actually more of a serious topic, that is climate change and how we all need to act on it (""Time will tell us, but we must act now""). I find it intriguing that the official ESC site says that their non qualification could be seen as a metaphor of ""society's willful ignorance towards the dangers of global warming"". Hmm... food for thought. Anyways, as I've said earlier, this song is easily Andorra's best preforming entry by far, but it still wasn't enough to qualify, as they finished 12th, just 11 points off of Moldova, who qualified in 10th place. This song suffered from the one semifinal system, as if it preformed just one year later, it would be Andorra's only qualification. Even though it failed to break the non-qualification duck, this song has picked up sort of a cult classic status among fans, as it is the gem from the micronation. 

### Morocco | 1980 | Samira Bensaid - Bitakat Hob
***See above***

### Slovakia | 1996 | [Marcel Palonder - Kým nás máš](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGWic-_QXI8&ab_channel=escLIVEmusic1)
**Contest Ranking**: 18th 
**My rankings**: 19th (15.837)

This is the highest Slovakia have ever finished at Eurovision to this day... and it's only 19th (18th at the contest). It's the only Slovak entry to qualify to the final, and it is the highest preforming song in both ESC and in this ranking. And of course the person behind this entry is practically anonymous compared to all the other acts from this list. All that I know of Marcel Palonder is that a. He is a Slovak singer, b. He was born in Humenné, Czechoslovakia, which is at the base of the volcanic Vihorlat mountains, c. He is on this list twice, as he represented Slovakia again in 2010, to less success than this one, and d. His song has 4.7 stars on Eurovision World. It's unfortunate that I can't do this entry the justice that it deserves, because this song survived the quite frankly ridiculous qualifying round, as it finished 17th with 38 points (the last country to qualify was Finland, with 26 points). 

This song is actually quite beautiful, as Mr. Palonder gives a soulful performance of his song, which is about, you guessed it, love! Specifically, he sings about how he wants love to protect him and his partner (Kým nás máš = Love protect us), and how as long as they have one another, love will shine, even when dreams are wondering in the dark (it probably sounds better in Slovak). The backing ladies on this track really add to this, making this song feel like a plea to whatever love gods exists, because he really wants to be with this person. It also helps that the orchestra ***really*** adds to the emotion of the track, especially in the chorus (I know I keep harping on about the orchestras* in these songs, but that's because they really do bring out the best in them). All in all, this track is pretty great, as it is now my favorite Slovak entry, If I were a juror back then, I would make sure that this song would be in the top ten, because this is a track that deserves at least 14th place. Now can you guess what I'm about to say now. ***Clears throat*** Sadly, while this entry does have more countries on its side than all of the other songs from Slovakia, it wasn't much of an improvement, as they have gone from 19th in '94 to 18th in '96. And with a grand total of 19 points, they are clearly the best entry that Slovakia has produced (in terms of results, I'm pretty sure 2010 is the more popular entry). And yeah, this result meant that Slovakia would be relegated ***again***, and seeing how it has gone since then, it hasn't been the greatest of rides. 

* I find it very funny that it was Israel (well actually the IBA) that got rid of the orchestras as a cost cutting method in '99, there's just something about it...

### Montenegro | 2015 | [Knez - Adio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTyi2XeeoJU&ab_channel=EurovisionSongContest)
**Contest Ranking**: 13th 
**My rankings**: 14th (25.609)

After finally breaking through and reaching the Grand Final a year prior, Montenegro goes and achieves to this day their best ever result at the competition (it's not competing against much). Enter Nenad Knežević*, aka Knez, who rose to fame as a Montenegrin singer in the 90's by hoping on the dance pop craze of the time. He's an established artist, having recorded 6 studio albums before 2005. And according to his instagram, he's also a DJ, which is pretty neat! Anyway, he would be chosen to represent his country in the year 2015, singing a song written by Željko Joksimović, a name that you will see popping up ***many times*** later, but I'll save that for later.  

And if you have heard of Joksimović and his songs, you would easily be able to tell that this entry has his fingerprints all over it. This song is great, and the performance really gives it a haunting vibe that would make it stand out from all of its contemporaries. This song is about trying to saying goodbye (Adio) to a former love, no matter how painful the process is. It's a format that has been done several times at this competition, but the staging really makes this one unique, or at the very least, memorable, due to the seemingly strange dance they do before the last chorus. It turns out that this dance is a take on a traditional Montenegrin dance, where couples dance around in circles with their arms spread out wide like an eagle. I love how the performance takes what would be a happy dance between lovers and makes it sad, having Knez be in the middle with no partner to dance with (the women dance around him, but you get my point). I also love how you can hear the emotion from the song, because its meant to be emotional, and Knežević does a great job of selling it. I did not realize before this song that I would be so attached to it, in fact, after this I'm going to watch it again, and you should too! Now where was I? Oh yes, so this song would sneak in into the Grand Final, finishing 9th, and at the Grand Final, it would finish 13th, a current record for the nation. It was actually top 10 with the public, getting 9th, while the juries didn't appreciate the song as much, placing it 11th. 

* He would marry Ninosleva Knežević and have two daughters with her, with one of them being Ksenija Knežević, who would go ***loco loco*** with Hurricane just a couple of years after this entry!

### San Marino | 2019 | [Serhat - Say Na Na Na](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5arNtTYK1s&ab_channel=EurovisionSongContest)
**Contest Ranking**: 19th
**My rankings**: 14th (46.791)

At number 1 for the first batch of countries is the unlikely story of Serhat, with his song ""Say Na Na Na"" for the last contest before the pandemic. San Marino in Eurovision has been a ride, to say the least. They were one of the last countries to make their ESC debut, as they joined in 2008. They had to pull out for financial reasons, so the next time they participated would be in the year 2011. Since the micro nation has a small pool of singers to choose from, you will most likely see some repeat performers from them, as they have sent Senhit (2011, 2020*, 2021), and Valentina Monetta(2012, 2013, 2014, 2017), but on this repeat list lies Ahmet Serhat Hocapaşalioğlu (2016, 2019), a Turkish born singer, former game show host, and entrepreneur. Serhat was chosen back in 2016 to represent San Marino but didn't qualify, getting a measly 12 points in the semi-final. According to him, in 2019, he would be called by San Marino's broadcaster to make a song to represent them again. And also according to him, he sat down and wrote the song in five minutes! It would be accepted and off he went to Tel Aviv to sing about saying ""Na Na Na""! You can tell this song was written so fast, the message is so simple, but also very catchy. Simply put, if you're down, call Serhat, and he'll tell you life is beautiful and fine and to say... well you already know. This song by itself would not go that far, but Serhat's enthusiasm, combined with the fact that he preformed last in his semifinal, equaled an unlikely qualification to the Grand Final, their first one since 2014! Now of course, enthusiasm can only go so far, as they finished just inside the top 20 on the night, but of course his placing would be the best San Marino have done to this day! All it took was a man using his inner feelings (from an album that talks about how he feels), and some Eurovision magic (I think)! 

## Final Thoughts
Well that's the first five countries done, and overall it was pretty nice looking at songs I didn't think much about when I initially watched the shows they were apart of (besides ***Say Na Na Na***). But what do you think? Were these countries treated harshly? (probably) Should some of theme come back to ESC? (definately) Could you see any Arab nation coming to ESC anytime soon? (Probably not, which is a shame.)",1710950834.0,2024-03-21T02:07:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1bjh4lj/ranking_the_top_52_eurovision_song_contest/

How are people keeping their Eurovision related excitement going until May now national final season is over?,1betzr1,67,"Personally I'm listening to this years songs, but trying to make sure I don't listen too much or I'll get bored of them. 

The national final season kept me excited to have something to look forward to watching each evening. 

I've been watching overthinking Eurovision videos a lot. I will probably rewatch some old editions too and I've not seen any of the semis from before 2015",1710445279.0,2024-03-15T05:41:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1betzr1/how_are_people_keeping_their_eurovision_related/
Winner always sends a bad song the year after?,1bbdcgc,77,"When a country wins Eurovision, they always send a bad song the year after. I hate to be hateful, but there's no way so many people actually thought Marcus & Martinus were the best at Melodifestivalen yesterday, right? It's a decent song, but far from the best, IMO.

Same thing happened the last time Sweden won in 2015. Most people I talked to agreed that our 2016 song was pretty awful in comparison. Is it because hosting Eurovision is expensive?

Edit: I'm mostly talking about Sweden in recent years, sorry if I didn't make that clear.",1710085546.0,2024-03-11T01:45:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1bbdcgc/winner_always_sends_a_bad_song_the_year_after/

The UVPSM Debrief - My Experience,1ax9h84,35,"   Hi everyone, I'm currently at the Munich airport writing this. Our flight to Helsinki leaves in a few hours, so I have enough time to do this debrief of the Una Voce Per San Marino semifinal. Feel free to ask me anything in this post as well!

   **This will be a rather long post so TL;DR:** It was an amazing experience, the quality of the songs was much higher than I expected! The semifinal filming was a very efficient experience - I arrived, they put me on stage, I sang my song, and that was it. I am very proud of getting this far in the contest and I'll keep making music to eventually end up in Eurovision. Everyone was super friendly at the semifinal also!   

#    A Little Bit About Me   

   First of all, I am not a professional musician. I'm currently writing my thesis on cell biology, music is right now just a side thing for me. I started playing guitar at 8 years old (currently 25 y.o.), and have been writing songs maybe since 2015. My Eurovision bug was the same as my music bug, watching Lordi win in 2006. I then gravitated towards the guitar.   

   I've been sending songs to UMK every year since 2017, and I intend to do that still, probably until I die lol. Getting to be a part of a Eurovision entry in any capacity is my end goal and dream in music. I see my semifinal place in UVPSM as an amazing step towards that dream!   

   My musical influences vary a lot, I just write the types of songs that I currently enjoy listening to. Broadly speaking, Guns N' Roses is my favourite band and Slash is my favourite guitarist. However, I try to broaden my taste with a bit of disco, funk, and the occasional pop song (My first release on Spotify is rough, but it's a parody of the Swedish summer pop songs like Samir & Viktor).   

   If you want to listen to some of my stuff, here's my [Spotify page](https://open.spotify.com/artist/45estJfvbIDPTWlB8n4Nql?si=eIextndRSv-w0BvYQKaAFQ)   

#    Una Voce Per San Marino   

   This was the first time for me to even apply for UVPSM, the openness of the competition flew completely under my radar until last year. I had two songs written for Eurovision this year, so I decided to send one of them (Try My Luck) to UVPSM and the other song (What My Future Holds) to UMK. The usual rejection letter came from UMK, but San Marino invited me to the auditions!   

   The actual audition was a very smooth experience. I just had to perform two songs via Zoom to the judges and they would decide later if I was any good. This audition was also my first time performing live in any capacity since 2017 with my old high school band (Lukio in Finnish, not sure if high school is correct), so I was very hyped. Apparently my song was good enough for the contest, and I found out about my semifinal participation the same day as everyone else. Then I had to quickly book all the flights and hotels and such, because I only had two weeks until the show. Thankfully my partner was free from her studies precisely on the week of the semifinals, so she was able to come with me on this very short notice.   

   Just a week before my semifinal, I got a cold. That was a pretty major setback as I really couldn't practice my singing (my worst trait as a musician, I'll be the first one to admit). I was still having a slight cold during my performance, but this is entering the excuses-territory. Another setback was that UVPSM did not allow vocals in the backing track. My song had some fun little harmonies that I was not able to utilize in my performance, so that was a bummer.   

   The day of the semifinal recording was quite hectic and fast. I just had to arrive 8.30 in the morning and the semifinal started at 9.30. There was no soundcheck or practice run (It figures, doing soundcheck on 30 songs in one hour is just not feasible). So everyone had to perform ""cold"". When my turn came, I got to the stage, sang the song and exited for the interview part. All the staff were really nice and helpful and super fast with everything!   

   I have to say, the third semifinal was brutal. I think there were many songs that should have been able to qualify further, my personal favorites of the NQs were Karma and Malvax. Also, The Atlantis was really helpful and friendly, he translated some of the stuff the staff was saying to me. Also also, Elina was Swedish, so I had someone to chat with in my native language backstage! I wish everyone in the semifinal good luck in their future endeavors!   

#    Conclusion   

   Overall, I am really proud and happy with myself. The competition was filled to the brim with professionals and X-Factor competitors and what not, and then there was little old me, someone who just writes songs by themselves at home during their free time. I did my very best despite the circumstances and this whole experience was the closest I've ever gotten to being in Eurovision!   

   Both my new songs will be released in a few weeks, I just have to do some small adjustments once I get home. I always tinker with my songs way too much.   

   Thanks for reading this wall of text!

🎵The Throwback Thursday Supervote🎵 - Heat Four: Stockholm 2016,1alt78f,105,"**Welcome back to the Throwback Thursday Supervote!**

As a reminder of the format, each week we'll be revisiting a past contest from Malmö 2013 to Malmö 2024, sharing fond memories and voting on our favourites as a reddit community. The **top 8** countries from each vote will advance to the next round, where they will join the top 8 of our regular 2024 ranking thread. These votes will run weekly until the end of April, when finally we will crown **the subreddit's favourite Eurovision entry ever!**

Last week we voted on Vienna 2015, and [these eight countries](https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1ajesvf/the_throwback_thursday_supervote_vienna_2015/) qualified to the semi-finals.

EDIT: This vote has now closed, stay tuned for the results!

# ~Heat Four: Stockholm 2016~

Having waited over a decade to secure their fifth win, the Swedes saw Eurovision head to home soil twice in four years! This time, the contest headed to the capital Stockholm, hosted in the 16,000 spectator capacity Globe Arena where many Melodifestivalen finals and Eurovision 2000 had previously been held. If 2013 was the Swedes taking a minimalistic production approach, 2016 was SVT pulling out all the stops, impressing with distinctive angular LED screens, sharp direction, bombastic strobe lighting and all sorts of nifty visual effects, including holographic wolves! The hosting duo of Petra Mede and reigning champion Måns Zelmerlöw remain one of the most popular hosting duos in the contest's history, aided by some brilliant sketches and visual gags. And there were format changes afoot once more, as the scoring system was overhauled to create a separate set of jury and televote points, a format which has remained to today!

This scoring change made for an exciting and climactic voting system, where **Ukraine's** **Jamala** earnt the Eastern nation's second victory by finishing 2nd in both the televote and jury votes, narrowly beating televote favourite Russia and jury winner Australia. The final scoreboard featured many surprises, from perennial backmarkers Bulgaria finishing 4th in only their second appearance in a Eurovision final, Lithuania enjoying a rare top 10 appearance, Czech Republic qualifying for the first time ever and Poland scoring a massive 222 televote points despite only receiving 7 from the juries! Whilst several countries enjoyed successful returns, Bosnia & Herzegovina failed to qualify in their only entry of the past decade, whilst Nordic countries other than the hosts enjoyed an unprecedentedly poor year.

What are your thoughts on the contest? Please share them in the comments!

🎵The Throwback Thursday Supervote🎵 - Heat Three: Vienna 2015,1ag8ovn,94,"**Welcome back to the Throwback Thursday Supervote!**

As a reminder of the format, each week we'll be revisiting a past contest from Malmö 2013 to Malmö 2024, sharing fond memories and voting on our favourites as a reddit community. The **top 8** countries from each vote will advance to the next round, where they will join the top 8 of our regular 2024 ranking thread. These votes will run weekly until the end of April, when finally we will crown **the subreddit's favourite Eurovision entry ever!**

Last week we voted on Copenhagen 2014, and [these eight countries](https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1adubw1/the_throwback_thursday_supervote_copenhagen_2014/) qualified to the semi-finals.

EDIT: The voting has now closed! Stay tuned for the results tomorrow afternoon!

# ~Heat Three: Vienna 2015~

Thanks to Conchita's Wurst's victory, Eurovision returned to Austrian soil for the first time since 1967. As the contest's 60th edition, there was a celebratory feeling in the air - the EBU marked the occasion by inviting Australia to make a 'one-off guest appearance', exciting the thousands of Aussie and ex-patriot fans who had loyally watched the show for years, even waking up in the early hours of the morning to view! With the slogan 'building bridges', the theme art emulated the distinctive neon tubes which decorated the distinctive 'eyeball' stage. Whilst the stage lacked the expensive glitziness of Copenhagen and new editions like noticeable canned applause divided fans, the contest remains many people's favourites thanks to the quality of songs on offer.

The top end of the scoreboard was filled with a mixture of usual heavy-hitters and underdog glories. **Måns Zelmerlöw** romped to a runaway victory as Sweden secured their second win in four years, despite finished 3rd in the televote. Perennial forerunners Russia and Italy rounded off the podium, whilst Australia immediately made a strong impression with 5th place. Conversely, Latvia and Israel finally overcame long non-qualification streaks to return to the top 10, whilst Belgium and Estonia also scored well.

What are your thoughts on the contest? Please share them in the comments!

# ~How to Vote~

To vote, please submit your ranking as a top-level comment in this thread. You can either submit **your top ten** **or your full ranking** of all 37 entries. Your ranking will then be transformed into a Eurovision style vote - 12 points for your #1, 10 points for your #2, and so on. The vote will be open until **Sunday 4th February 23:59CET;** the results will then be posted in a separate post at the start of the next week.

u/TrollHunter87 will very kindly be using his automated script to collate these rankings. If you want to ensure that your vote counts, make sure that:

1. You provide your ranking in a top-level comment
2. You write the countries in separate lines, and the lines start with a number (example: ""1. United States"")
3. You either use the Country name, the song name or the flag emoji of the country.
4. You can't have a tie between songs
5. Don't just put ""1."" at the start of every row and let reddit do its thing. Actually put the all the numbers from 1 to 10 in the markdown
6. If you're unsure, just look at the other comments. Almost all of them are valid.

What are some unusual Eurovision facts that others may not know?,18zpuc7,52,"I'm always a fan of unusual facts (or ""Freaky Facts"" as my family calls it) and I was wondering if there are some unusual facts about Eurovision that people may not know or realize until someone points them out to you. For example:

* The Lowest Placing in Eurovision History was Germany 2015 with nul points. When Australia was added as an extra Automatic Qualifier alongside the usual host country/previous winner (Austria) and the Big 5. (Although, in my opinion, Black Smoke absolutely did not deserve it, especially since the only reason they were there is because they were tied with Austria in having 0 points, and they were placed last because they performed after Austria.)
* Almost every letter of the main 26-letter Latin alphabet (excluding diacritics and extra letters found in the alphabets for North Germanic and Slavic languages) can be found in the names of every country that has participated in Eurovision. The only letter not found in any Eurovision country   
is Q.

My ranking of Eurovision song based on if I think they are overrated or underrated.,18yusby,49,"This is my list of songs that I think are overrated or underrated in eurovision
The position I think they deserved to be in will be placed in Astriks ***

Very Overrated (Not in order)

- Mikolas Josef ""Lie to Me"" 🇨🇿 2018 *12th*
  - I forget who said this, but someone said this song seem very ""tryhard"", I agree.  I love this song, but 6th place seems a bit high.

- Duncan Lawrence ""Arcade"" 🇳🇱 2019 *8th*
    - This song isnt bad, I just don't think it deserved to win.  He has great vocals but the song seems pretty basic.

- KEIINO ""Spirit In The Sky"" 🇳🇴 2019 *16th*
  - I just don't understand the hype.  It is a fun song, don't get me wrong.  I would have much rather Azerbaijan being here instead thoigh

- Mahmood ""Soldi"" 🇮🇹 2019 *14th*
  - I just don't understand it, simple as that

- Salvador Sobral ""Amar Pelos Dois"" 🇵🇹 *NQ*
  - I don't understand it, not sure why, it's also too slow for my liking.  His voice kinda annoying.

- Ochman ""River"" 🇵🇱 2022 *20th*
  - I like this song a little bit, 12th place is just weird to me, it isn't anything special that other songs don't do better.

- The Rasmus ""Jezebel"" 🇫🇮 2022 *NQ*
  -I'm all game for a goofy song, but no matter what I can't take this song seriously, there for I don't understand why it did so well in eurovision

- Chanel ""Slomo"" 🇪🇸 2022 *15th
  - I understand the Sexual Aspect is mostly why it got a lot of votes, the performance is also very professional.  I just don't like songs(most of the time) when I can't understand the lyrics, also I'm gay, so the performance doesn't get me going.

- Benjamin Ingrosso ""Dance you Off"" 🇸🇪 2017 *14th*
  - please don't get me started

- Ermal Meta & Fabrizio Moro ""Non mi Avete Fatto Niente"" 🇮🇹 2018 *26th*
  - Song just seems too all over the place, seems like the song has an identity crisis 😳 

- Måneskin ""Zitti e Bouni"" 🇮🇹 2021 *22th*
  - too loud for chaotic for my liking.  Even if I spoke Italian I doubt I would know what he is saying

- Hatari ""Hatrid Mun Sigra"" 🇮🇸 2019 *NQ*
  - I just want to start off by saying that this is so different to what they sent in 2020 and 2021.

- Conan Osiris ""Telemóvies"" 🇵🇹 *NQ*
  - I'm not exactly changing the position for this song, butni want to state that this song is absolute 💩


Very Underrated (not in order)


- Srbuk ""Walking out"" 🇦🇲 2019 *16th*
  - She is amazing, I really hope she is able to return someday with maybe a back round (a) Dancer(s) or something

- Jowst ""Grab the Moment"" 🇳🇴 2017 *2nd*
  - This got 10th place, so it isn't exactly underrated, but I think this deserves to get talked about more.

- Måns Zelmerlöw ""Heros"" 🇸🇪 2015 *1st*
  - he is my favorite solo artist ever, so I might be bias, especially since this won in 2015, but it is one of those ones that gets forgotten sometimes, but this is one one that will probably be the easiest the change my mind on.

- Zena ""Like It"" 🇧🇾 2019  *10th*
  - Belarus is questionable right now... but ignoring that, she sounds amazing live, don't exactly understand why she did so bad

- S!sters ""Sister"" 🇩🇪 2019 *15th*
  -They might not of sounded the best live, but they didn't sound bad by any means, I think there was worse that year.

- Lea Sirk ""Hvala Ne!"" 🇸🇮 2018  *9th*
  - There are only a handful of songs that I like that aren't in English, this is one of the few, I've never even looked up the translated lyrics, it's just groovy.  

- Victor Crone ""Storm"" 🇪🇪 2019 *13th*
  -The lyrics are kinda cheesy, but I still like it, voice sounds good aswell.  The ppreformence was well done

- Nadir Rustimli ""Fade to Black"" 🇦🇿 2022 *3rd*
  - Do I need to explain myself?  I was upset when I saw how badly he did, I won't have complained if he won tbh.  Vocals are impeccable.

- Andrea ""Circles"" 🇲🇰 2022 *17th*
  - She just sounds great, wish they could afford better staging

- Tusse ""Voices"" 🇸🇪 2021 *7th*
  - kinda a small jump here, but this is one of my favorite entries that qualified but didn't place in the top 10.

- Michela ""Chameleon"" 🇲🇹 *8th*
  - The running ordered really messed her chances of doing well in the final

No hate to any of the artists, this is just my personal opinion

HAPPY HOLIDAYS!
Also please no hate, it took me like 2 hours to make this and get the new placements I gave them as accurate as i can",1704419636.0,2024-01-05T11:53:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/18yusby/my_ranking_of_eurovision_song_based_on_if_i_think/

14. Azerbaijan - 2011 - Ell and Nikki

1. Måns Zelmerlöw - 'Hero's' 🇸🇪 2015
  - I don't even know where to start, he's just amazing.  He sounds great live, not the best that year, but definitely top 3 vocally.  Staging was, I don't want to say innovative, but definitely unique, no other staging was close to what Måns's team did.  The song writing itself is I think a bit above Average.  It's pretty basic, but it gets the job done, his other music has better lyrics.  I am so glad he won 2015.  People sometimes hate on him for showing up in Eurovison to much since he won, but I just think it shows him much he loves the contest and the eurovsion Community.

2. Loreen 'Euphoria' 🇸🇪 2012
  - This is undoubtedly one of the most iconic Eurovisin songs ever to grace the stage.  Vocals were Amazing,  and she was dancing while doing that.  No, not just walking around and moving her hands around.  This girl was flailing her arms around(in a controlled way)  I can't do that movements, period, let alone whilst singing.  

3. Conchita Wurst 'Rise Like A Pheonix' 🇦🇹  2014
  - What a Voice!  And bold, Imagine the confidence she had to have to do that, with a smile the whole time!  The song writing was about average, but she really got the message thought to the audience and viewers at home.  

4. Alexander Rybak 'Fairytale' 🇳🇴 2009
  -  When I first heard this song I didn't think it was anything special, ad I've listened to it more and more I've grown to really appreciate the song.  He is smiling the whole time, which is very helpful to set the mood for the preformence.  The violin is iconic,  when I first heard this song I didn't see the live preformence, I had no idea that the violin was coming.

5. Loreen 'Tattoo' 🇸🇪 2023
  - First of all, she totally deserved to win.  The preformence was great, she somehow didn't look out of breath during that whole thing, which is crazy to me.  Vocals started off just a little bit off, but by the end she sounded better the the studio version.

6. Netta 'Toy"" 🇮🇱 2018
  - Ok, I'm not saying this is bad, but fuego was better in every way besides Uniqueness.  And it terms of chicken noises, lol.  It's an intriguing song for sure.  That note at the end is so raspy, I love it!  I wasn't upset that she won, was just a bit annoyed Cyprus didn't win.  The cats in the backround are fun though.

7. Lena 'Satilite' 🇩🇪 2010
  - I didn't watch this year live, so I watched a recap that somebody did, and I do r remember who I expected to win, but it sure as hell wasnt Germany.  But I'm glad Germany got there Moment in modern eurovision history.  Lena seems some wholesome aswell

8. Emmelie De Forest 'Only Teardrops' 🇩🇰 2013
  - I didn't exactly this this should have one, but it's grown on me a lot, but looking back I'm not sure who I would want to win instead. But the preformece was well executed.  Nothing more to say, pretty mid-table in my opinion.

9. Jamala '1944' 🇺🇦 2016
  - Vocals are impeccable, it's jiat not my style of song, that note at the end, is CRAZY.  I would have been happier if Australia or Bulgaria won.  But it is what it is, and this one has grown on me like some of the other ones.

10. Kalush Orcastra 'Stefania' 🇺🇦 2022
  - I don't hate this song, but I feel like if Ukraine sent anything half decent this year(again, not saying this song doesn't apply) they would have done very well or won.  I'm not saying they didn't deserve to win.  The preformence was done well.

11. Duncan Lawrence 'Arcade' Netherlands 2019
  - This would be higher if it.wasnt overplayed.  Overplayed or not I still don't get the hype.  It's good but the most streamed eurovision song EVER.  It doesn't make sense to me, but it doesn't have to make sense.

12. MåneSkin 'Zitti e Buoni' 🇮🇹 202q
  -  I just don't like rock.  In term of rock songs, it's good, but tp me if for for the most starts.just sound like screaming.  Great stage usage though, not one bit of the main part of the stage felt wasted.

13. Salvador Sobral 'Amar pelos dois' 🇵🇹 2017.
  - This was my last place until I remembered that Azerbaijan in 2011 had a somewhat obvious cheating scandal.  Anyways, this song just kinda gets in ym nerves, in my opinion completely undeserved win.

14. Ell and Nikki 'Running Scared' 🇦🇿 2011
   - Ok, where do I start.  RIGGED.  I think most ""hardcore"" wurovision fans are aware of the cheating scandal.  This only had.q thing going for it, being the song with the most professional vibe.  Lyrics, dog-water.  Corrigraphy, dog-💩.  Vocals, horrific. If your going to cheat to win atleast cheat to have a good song win. Not this mess.

Thank you reading.  Please don't hate me for my own opinions.",1704353853.0,2024-01-04T17:37:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/18y7hc9/my_ranking_of_the_last_14_eurovision_winners_2009/
Australia at the Eurovision Song Contest 🇦🇺 (2023 - 2015) | #UnitedByMusic,18qdia9,20,,1703487599.0,2023-12-25T16:59:59,https://youtu.be/3aqsbQlZCPA?si=u1dZtbeYJUv25_tx
List of potential participants for Etapa Nationala 2024🇲🇩,18nu6s8,24,"The application period for Etapa Nationala 🇲🇩 closes tomorrow which means we'll know the names of the competing artists soon. I compiled a list of who I think might've applied, based on rumours, hints from artists and just my own speculation.

1. Aliona Moon - I asked her on IG a while back if she'd try again to which she said she would if she has the right song. Lately she's been liking all the comments on social media asking her to come back so I'll take that as a sign😜
2. Lemonique - You might remember them from [2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTN4QXRI-yY) or [2019](https://youtu.be/acj1o6Mmieo). They replied to a comment under one of their videos saying they'll come back to Eurovision 'soon'. Considering that was 6 months ago I can only assume that means it'll be this year. They're quite promising too so I'm excited for them!
3. Adelina Iordachi - She was in last year's auditions with [Deja Vu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPgeTL7zHKY) and needed 1 more point to qualify to the final. She was also Pasha's backing vocalist/dancer in Liverpool. In an interview before Eurovision she confirmed she'll try again this year, and I know she's been working with Arsenium (Moldova 2006, also ex O-Zone member) and Ester Peony (Romania 2019) so I'm expecting her to come with a bop penned by these two.
4. Valeria Pasha - The other one of Pasha's backing singers/dancers. When asked if she applied she  said something along the lines of 'it's a surprise, you'll know after December 22nd' which indicates to me she did. She's tried a few times in the past, coming 2nd in [2015](https://youtu.be/d8deT6p_zkc) and winning the jury in both 2015 and [2016](https://youtu.be/6nOVecokb2I). The most recent of her attempts was in 2020 when she came 5th with [It's Time](https://youtu.be/-I4kzEylvZo). She was in a songwriting camp organized by Pasha so there is a chance her potential entry would have been written there.
5. Sunstroke Project - They were supposed to release a song called ""Cherchez la femme"" this summer but then the release got delayed indefinitely. It still hasn't been released but they've been teasing it so my guess is that they might be keeping it for Eurovision. I definitely think they would wanna go to Eurovision one more time to help them stay relevant for the rest of their music career but at the same time they had a bit of beef last year with the organizers so I'm not as sure about them.
6. Molda The Dog - A new name in the Moldovan music scene. They released their debut single [Venin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKNicOXlhkA) a month ago and someone commented 'Eurovision 2024' under the music video to which they replied with ""of course"". The song is quite good imo, it's not clear if they're coming with this one or something else but it looks like they'll be there.
7. Catarina Sandu - The fandom's favorite in 2020 with [Die For You](https://youtu.be/ZXNK1RpiZ2o). A few months ago she said she has a big surprise coming that she can't yet reveal and I'm hopeful it's a Eurovision return. She was studying in the Netherlands until last summer so I'm assuming that's the reason she hasn't made a comeback yet, but now she's back in Moldova and looking to kickstart her music career again so participating in Etapa Nationala would probably be a good move for her regardless of if she wins it or not.
8. Carine - I asked her about submitting her single [On My Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNotvqW1uww) and she said 'I gave her something to think about'. Carine is currently based in Romania though so normally it would make more sense for her to submit it there, but since Romania most likely won't have a NF if they do participate I have some hopes to see her in Etapa Nationala.
9. Mihaela Andrei - She participated in 2022 with [Libre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4AAQo4DSE8). Mihaela was in the same show where Valeria hinted at her participation and she gave a similar response to Valeria when asked about Eurovision
10. Donia - You probably remember her from last year when she finished 5th with [Red Zone](https://youtu.be/rxz1czskHII). She released a new [single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh3NIomLNUY) in September that would be eligible. I asked her if she plans on submitting it to Etapa Nationala and she said she'll think about it but she's not too sure if it's worth it. Not getting my hopes up for her but wouldn't be surprised to see it in the line-up
11. Maria Ciolac - TRM confirmed she's the first one to have applied. At the end of this [video](https://fb.watch/p4io_rwEkq/) you can hear a snippet of the song. It's supposedly written by the Persson sisters
12. As I've already mentioned, Pasha organized a songwriting camp mostly for new/unknown artists and their PR person already confirmed there will be a few names from the camp in Eurovision, so it is not unlikely that we'll get at least one song penned by Pasha himself.
13. Sasha Bognibov - well, he already released the song so yeah, sadly we'll have to see him again

Personally I also really want Maxim Zavidia to come back but there haven't been any hints from him so I didn't include him.",1703184651.0,2023-12-22T04:50:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/18nu6s8/list_of_potential_participants_for_etapa/

Eduard Romanyuta - I want your love (Moldova) 2015 Eurovision Song Contest,17wnjot,10,"I am shocked that Moldova didn't even qualify with this song, the beat is catchy and the overall song is great, it is definitely on my top 10 songs in Eurovisision.",1700143198.0,2023-11-16T23:59:58,https://youtu.be/mVN723iwj8c?si=ITdRsLKAtHqCdla4
Something I realized about Italy's lack of female representation in the eurovision,17kks9s,74,"Everyone already talked about it. about the lack of female representation in Italy. since 2017 only men won the Sanremo festival (+Victoria from Maneskin, but she is not a lead singer so...)

as we know, the eurovision representation is the one that won Sanremo. so nowadays many people are upset that since 2015 there have been no women who won Sanremo and represented Italy in the eurovision

of course, when you pick your eurovision entries you need to think about the song and not the gender of the artist. but I think that we can't deny that the countries who are biased towards a specific gender think that with this gender they can have more success. with Mans's victory in 2015, Sweden was obsessed with picking handsome guys with pop songs, maybe to recreate this success. The same thing for Ukraine. for years they picked mostly women (from 2008 to 2016 in back to back) because when they picked men they got lower places (this until Kalush's victory in 2022. or Verca since she is a drag queen so...)

why I'm talking about this?

because I saw many people saying ""Italy mostly picks men because the three women who represented Italy since their return in 2011 did not make good results as the men"" and from the one hand it's legit claim because:

- Nina - she got the 9th place. still, this is the lowest top 10 result since the return in 2011

- Emma - 24th place. the lowest place Italy got since the return

- Francesca - 16th place. which is a decent place for a strong year like 2016 but not close to the men

but from the other hand, **NONE OF THOSE WOMEN WERE SANREMO WINNERS!**

- Nina - the winner of 2012 was Emma. but the same as Albania this year, there was a separate voting for the eurovision representation whith Nina won. but it not end here because the song Nina went to the Eurovision which is not the song she competed in the Sanremo. the composer of her Sanremo song did not want to send the song to Eurovision so Nina had to go with other song which is is not in the style of other Italian entries. so not only Nina is not a Sanremo winner, the entry is not her Sanremo song

- Emma - the winner of 2014 was Arisa, the last woman who won Sanremo. But she did not represent Italy in the Eurovision because Italy's broadcast network decided to make an internal selection and chose Emma Marone two years after she won the Sanremo. so not only the 2014 artist is not a Sanremo winner, she was not a Sanremo artist for 2014. 

- Francesca - ok, this time she is a Sanremo artist and she went to the eurovision with her Sanremo song (the only woman who sang the same song in both Sanremo and Eurovision). but she was not the winner of Sanremo 2016. The rock band Stadio (men only) won the Sanremo. but they did not want to go to the eurovision. so Francesca, the runner-up, got the offer to represent Italy, and she agreed (and I'm glad because her song is so charming)

so when we try to compare the men's results to the women's results to say ""Men have better results so it's obvious they would be biased towards men"", it's not 100% legit compression because all the women who represented Italy went to the Eurovision under different circumstances while all the men are the Sanremo winners. so if we really want to check and see if women can get the same good results as men (or lower) we need to compare the male sanremo winners to the female sanremo winners who went to eurovision (which did not happened since Italy return in 2011)

of course I'm not saying that you need to pick a winner based on gender, but still, it could be nice to give some women chances to win Sanremo and represent Italy in the eurovision (I mean, it helped for Sweden so...)",1698758105.0,2023-10-31T23:15:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/17kks9s/something_i_realized_about_italys_lack_of_female/
My Eurovision Workout Playlist,1781190,2,"A few weeks ago there was a thread on Eurovision workout playlists, which inspired me to put together one of my own. Here were the principles I applied:

* As this is a workout playlist, the beat has to kick in within a reasonable amount of time after the start of the song (this is why Euphoria is excluded, for instance)

* As this playlist is organized by BPM, the speed shouldn't change very much over the course of the song (I made an exception for Shum)

* No losing national final entries (sorry, Run to the Hills)

* Where possible, split up songs with the same key and BPM

And here's the playlist:

ESC Songs in other languages,16h2um8,75,"Im wondering what Eurovision songs have versions in other languages and if there are some which you prefer more than the original. I know that a lot of Balkan songs have English versions for example: BiH 2012, Croatia 1998, Slovenia 2022/23, BiH 2007 just to name a few. In the same way a lot of Balkan songs which were performed in English have a version in their native language: Serbia 2015, Croatia 2002, 2011, 2019, 2022 as well as Slovenia 2011. I recently stumbled upon a Greek, Portuguese and Spanish versions of Oro (Serbia 2008) and I was amazed mostly because the songs weren’t translated literally so each version has its own unique charm",1694552178.0,2023-09-13T06:56:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/16h2um8/esc_songs_in_other_languages/
Predict the Next 10 Winners,16fujm9,18,"The most arbitrary prediction thread of all time, but I thought it'd be fun to look back on and see just how wrong we are, especially as trends of form sway so quickly, and countries which at one stage seemed destined to win (again) have often faded into mediocrity (i.e. Romania in the late 2000s, Bulgaria only a few years ago). 

Our last 10 winners were: Ukraine x2 (2016, 2022), Sweden x2 (2015, 2023), Denmark (2013), Austria (2014), Portugal (2017), Israel (2018), The Netherlands (2019) and Italy (2021). Some were pretty strong candidates for victory given their form (Sweden, Denmark at the time, Ukraine, Italy) whilst others were real underdog countries. Inevitably we will again have some surprise countries win in the next decade, but to the best of my ability here's my ten picks for victory. Feel free to also give your own justifications or even wilder predictions like artists/genres!

# Group A: Golden Selections

**1): Spain**

I've been a following Eurovision closely since the early 2010s, and Spain has been a perennial fan-favourite, perhaps due to vocal Spanish eurofandom, frequently topping YouTube tops before under-performing on the big ESC stage. Now for the first time I believe the long-awaited 3rd Spanish victory is inevitable, and that's down to the strength of **Benidorm Fest**. The quality, variety and particularly the staging of the finalists this year was excellent, and whilst 'Eaea' proved too niche for the wider Eurovision audience, I feel like it's only a matter of time before they produce a winner. The massive local popularity of artists like the Tanxugueiras and the widespread success of 'Nochentera' are just a few of the positive signs!

**2): Serbia**

Again, the Serbian national final only seems to be growing in depth, quality and variety - the success of 'In Corpore Sano' and the popularity of 'Samo Mi Sa Spava' show their confidence in choosing unconventional entries. Coupled with strong diaspora support, one of these years I believe they'll strike gold again.

**3): Estonia**

Though it's not always translated to great Eurovision success, Eesti Laul has long been an excellent national final, and one of these years they'll strike gold again. Could be with Ollie (though 'Venom' will be hard to top), or with any number of other artists.

# Group B: In Form Nations

**4): Italy**

Consistent top 10 finishers over the last decade, it's hard to see this trend stopping so long as the top San Remo artists are also willing to go to Eurovision. San Remo is incredibly every year, and I honestly wouldn't be surprised to see Italy take more than one victory in the decade to come. Hopefully they do a better job of hosting next time they do.

**5): Norway**

Another country with a consistently awesome national final, with several amazing runners-up and finalists, and a veritable goldmine of artists willing to represent their nation. One of these years they'll find an entry which manages to strike a chord with the juries as well as the public to bring them a deserved fourth victory.

**6): Finland**

Once the ultimate underdogs of Eurovision, now on an incredible run of form. Every national final since 2021 has been thoroughly excellent (2022 had several amazing entries that lost out to the popularity to The Rasmus), and again so long as top local artists see the value in participating (which Kaarija's huge popularity should prove) I think we'll see a second Finnish victory soon. Some believe 'Cha Cha Cha' to be a one-off - I do not.

# Group C: The Debutantes 

**7): Armenia**

Again though their results haven't shown it, Armenia are on a good run of form at the moment, sending promising young artists and reigniting local passion. One of these years they'll strike gold like they've proven they can do in Junior Eurovision.

**8): Iceland**

Unlike my other choices, Iceland's national finals have been pretty poor of late. However they remain my outside pick for a surprise win some year - one of these years the passion of the nation will produce something amazing. It could well even be a triumphant return for Dadi Freyr, so long as he can entice Eastern televoters to show him the same love he enjoys in the west.

# Group D: When There's a Will, There's a Way

**9): France**

Recent success in Junior Eurovision shows that French interest in victory is rising, and the country has a rich musical interest ripe in talent outside of Eurovision. I see Barbara Pravi returning at some point in the next decade, either as a song-writer or as a performer, and again scoring well, potentially even winning; alternatively, one of these years they'll have a Sam Ryder like upcoming artists agree to represent them and will finally break their long wait for a 6th victory.

**10): Greece**

Having thrown away a great run of form this year, where do Greece go from here? At the moment it's hard to see them finding a winner, but within the next few years I expect there'll be some significant upheaval in regards to their selection methods. Quell their internal corruption and there are great artists willing to represent their nation, and I think one of them will be a winner.

**Honourable Mentions:**

**Israel:** Noa's success this year shows that Israel has top artists willing to contend for victory again.

**Portugal:** They only just got their first win last decade, so another victory so soon would be unexpected. However, Festival de Cancao has improved dramatically since their 2017 victory, and again I think the potential is there for them to strike gold in the national final, building on the good form of recent years.

**Ukraine:** Always a strong contender and now boosted by wider diaspora support and strong televote sympathy. Could well take a victory, particularly when/if they win the war. I'm not sure at this stage how the war will affect their music industry going forward.

**United Kingdom:** I'd love us to win, and I believe we *could* win. But I also think continued mediocrity is more likely so long as our top artists and upcoming talents don't want to represent us. And also there's some classic British pessimism in there too. I really hope we can consistently fight for top 10s again, but I don't want to bet on it.",1694436864.0,2023-09-11T22:54:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/16fujm9/predict_the_next_10_winners/

Making A Case For Every Winning Song 2006 - 2023,15s71ja,52,"**🇬🇷Greece 2006 - 🇫🇮 Lordi - Hard Rock Hallelujah**

Never before did heavy metal win Eurovision. It proved you can truly break barriers with music in this contest, irregardless to genre discrimination 

**🇫🇮Helsinki 2007 - 🇷🇸 Marija Serifovic - Molitiva**

A beautiful soulful melody mixing elements of R&B and soul with soft rock and folk. This was easily the standout song of the year and Marija brought the emotion and powerful lyrics to life.

**🇷🇸Belgrade 2008 - 🇷🇺 Dima Bilan - Believe**

A song of the time, that perfectly fitted into the Enrique, Justin Timberlake, and Nick Carter vibes that dominated the charts at the time. It had an incredible lyric presentation and one of the best producers in the world, Timberland.

**🇷🇺Moscow 2009 - 🇳🇴🇧🇾Alexander Rybak - Fairytale**

Quite possibly the greatest winner of all time. It was a simple presentation with catchy lyrics, an energetic yet toned down performance, and a talented, young musician twisting folk into pop, paving the way for winners in the future.

**🇳🇴Oslo 2010 - 🇩🇪 Lena - Satelite**

Much like Dima Bilan, Lena capatilised on catchy moments in pop at the time, combined with an earworm of a chorus. Admittedly, winning 2010 is an easy feat as it was a weak year.

**🇩🇪Dusseldorf 2011 - Eldar Gasimov and Nikki Jamal (🇦🇿Ell and 🇦🇿🇬🇧Nikki) - Running Scared**

A strong performance in a genre that had not won in over 20 years - a duet featuring a female and a male. It was a strong lyric presentation and a lovely love song.

**🇦🇿Baku 2012 - 🇸🇪🇲🇦 Loreen - Euphoria**

This song was 10 years ahead of the performance. It uses song melodies and instrumentals only just being introduced to the mainstream today. The dances, the the wind machine, the snow at the end...this, alongside Fairytale are the king and queen of Eurovision.

**🇸🇪Malmö 2013 - 🇩🇰 Emmelie De Forrest - Only Teardrops**

Similar to Fairytale, Only Teardrops encorporated folk style melodies into a pop song with a pop rock influence and a striking golden backdrop. 2013 was relatively lacklustre in comparison to other years, so she stood out in voting.

**🇩🇰Copenhagen 2014 - 🇦🇹 Conchita Wurst - Rise Like A Pheonix**

Clearly inspired by operatic pop and ballads, this song could pass for a James Bond theme. It is strong, it is powerful, and it is captivating. Conchita is a gay icon, and one of many winners who fly the flag of pride.

**🇦🇹Vienna 2015 - 🇸🇪Måns Zelmelöw - Heroes**

One of the strongest earworms you will hear in Eurovision. The performance and display standout, but also the catchy lyrics and chorus, and Måns impressive charisma helped everything come together.

**🇸🇪 Stockholm 2016 - 🇺🇦 Jamala - 1944**

A haunting yet oddly charming retrospective on the Crimean Tatars being persecuted in the 40s by an alleged alliance between Stalin and Hitler. It was a powerful singing performance and Jamala reached her voice out to the heavens. 2016 was really strong and this was one of many highlights.

**🇺🇦Kyiv 2017 - 🇵🇹 Salvador Sorbal - Amar Pelois Dois**

A stripped back, laid out love song that connects the love of the song with the beauty of love.

**🇵🇹Lisbon 2018 - 🇮🇱 Netta - Toy**

A chaotic mix of everything. Chicken clucks, keyboards, nekko, it was everything Netta needed to win. Her performance being in the middle of 🇭🇺AWS and 🇳🇱Waylon was a perfect pallete clenser.

**🇮🇱Tel Aviv 2019 - 🇳🇱 Duncan Laurence - Arcade**

2019 was the worst year in recent memory. It did barely anything and Duncan was the sole stand out artist not named 🇮🇸Hatari or 🇷🇺Sergey Lazarev. It was a very catchy ballad and one that would be the first to 1 billion listens on Spotify.

**🇳🇱Rotterdam 2021 - 🇮🇹 Måneskin - Zitti E Buoni**

With the charisma of this band and the sharp rock vibes they give out, it was inevitable this band was going to win - and that was even more intense when it became a three horse race early in the Jury votes between Italy, Switzerland and France. It truly was their 'ABBA' moment and the band is primed to take over the world in due course.

**🇮🇹Turin 2022 - 🇺🇦 Kalush Orchestra - Stefania**

You could say the vast displacement of Ukrainians had a hand, but this was a true hip hop and rap track, with plenty of Folk style elements which made it interesting start to finish.

**🇺🇦🇬🇧Liverpool 2023 - 🇸🇪🇲🇦 Loreen - Tattoo**

A tight contest between Loreen, 🇮🇱 Noa Kirel, and 🇫🇮 Karijja was the highlight this year, but Loreen hada pop track that was so close to EDM, it mixed over and her strong vocals and enterpritve dance really stole the show.",1692138075.0,2023-08-16T08:21:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/15s71ja/making_a_case_for_every_winning_song_2006_2023/
Rankin' All Of United Kingdom Acts 2007-2023,15khxob,14,"Time to torture myself...

Welcome to Rankin' where I rank all of the major countries acts 2007-2023, to my personal preference. This era I called the 'Re-Emergence' era as Eurovision is steadily returning to the gold days of old.

I am not a fan of my country. I hate it, and the music is worse. The last time we sent a good act was 2002...the rest have been mid. So let's do this, and have fun!

As a side note, I do not cover 2020 as it's a recorded and edited video against live performances.

**All Rankings Are Subject To change**

16 - Scooch - Flying The Flag (For You) (2007)

This...happened.

We actually sent an entire group of air hosts to represent our country. The sound mix was horrid, and it was clear none of the group could sing. The entire performance was gimmicked around an airplane and was incredibly cheesy.

This is one of my least favourite songs ever. Not just Eurovision.

15 - Josh Dubovie - That Sounds Good To Me (2010)

If not for the horror that was Sooch, Josh Dubovie would be dead last. It was a neck to neck race but this song is *slightly* better. I say slightly because I liked the boxes. That's it. That's my review of this performance.

It was boring, outdated, and again, it was clear Josh could not sing. 

Nice looking boxes.

14 - James Newman - Embers (2021)

Ugh.

The minute the beat hit I knew this would be horrible but I was not expecting this. It was generic, it was uninspired and NOBODY seemed to be into it. The crowd was quiet. Even with muted seats, you can hear the crowd...I struggled to hear them.

He took his loss like a champ however! Everyone applauded him for 0 points and it was a bittersweet moment.

13 - Michael Rice - Bigger Than Us (2019)

I don't know what to say here.

Michael was clearly nervous, but the song was INCREDIBLY outdated, and the song could not decide what it wanted to be. 

2019 was a shite year, this was towards the bottom of that year.

12 - Engelbert Humperdinck - Love Will Set You Free (2012)

I don't like sad songs.

This ballad felt like it really needed something to be good. It did not help the crowd was dead, and Engelbert had to warm them up first. He was way past his prime, and the BBC must have thought returns were the big thing as this was the second of three returns back to back, and this was...not there.

11 - Bonnie Tyler - Believe In Me (2013)

Again, Bonnie was past her prime.

One of the UKs biggest successes in the 90s, and this song just felt like it did nothing with her expansive vocal range. If anything, she was let down by the song choice. But also, she failed to stand out in a weak year.

10 - Andy Abrahams - Even If (2008)

I really liked the layed out soul and RnB vibes, but ultimately I just think it was the wrong to send. I can't remember the song 24 hours later and the performance was equally forgettable.

Andy, your a nice guy, but this was not it mate. Not it. You should have won X Factor though.

9 - Mae Muller - I Wrote A Song (2023)

You wrote a song that was...a grower.

I hated this song a few months ago. Now I say, it's a top half finish. But still a lower to mid level performance. But this was mainly due to the level of live performances Mae has had, and the nerves she had...

The performance was fun and the dancers seemed REALLY into it, especially the blonde haired one. She was picked way too early in her career to represent the country, but she did try!

8 - SuRie - Storm (2018) **Jury Rehearsal Footage**

SuRie was attacked on stage so I feel it is unfair to use the original version. This is the only time I'm going to make adjustments to rankings based on footage.

That aside, this was...average? It was a pop song that leaned into pop rock at times, and it feels like it lost its identity halfway through. But it stood out on a strong year, so it gets bonus points.

7 - Electro Velvet - Still In Love With You (2015)

This was something different which is why it's so high!

I've always enjoyed these jazzy, loungey swing songs and it was INSANELY catchy! But there were better acts our country has sent. And 2015 was an insanely strong year, but it did not deserve as low of a placement as it did.

6 - Lucie Jones - Never Give Up On You (2017)

Not usually a fan of pop ballads, but Lucie really crushed this song. It was very ethereal, very dreamlike, and it was...wow. it was something.

2017 was a one man show. Lucie tried her hardest to catch up, but it was not enough. Great use of pyro on this performance!

5 - Molly - Children of the Universe (2014)

This was one of our strongest hits in years, and the odds were in our favour... unfortunately, Molly had a weak performance and was clearly nervous. Not to mention, she was placed last (much like Mae Muller!).

That being said, this is the closest to a rock song we have had for the UK so that makes me happy. And the performance was not completely bad. It was mostly good! And Molly went to my college s whole 5 years before I went.

Unfortunately, Molly looks done with music and has settled down with a child now. 

4 - Sam Ryder - Spaceman (2022)

Time to get lynched.

I just don't think it was as good as people said it was! Power ballads are slightly better then ballads, but I just feel this was more mid then people make it out to be.

I remember the performance however, which means a lot. 

3 - Joe and Jake - You Are Not Alone (2016)

I was waiting for a duet like this. It was slow, it was relaxed, and sounded like it fit the theme of the year - very, very relaxed.

This was a top 5 song for me and by far a MUCH better act then Sooch nearly 10 years prior. One of the few acts I think could have won.

2 - Jade Ewen - It Is My Time (2009)

I don't like sad songs but WOW!

This was an exception. Jade can really sing, and there was only one real winner that year...Jade was my second place. 2009 was such a strong year and she stood alongside Alexander Rybak that year. 

If only Alex was not there...

1 - Blue - I Can (2011)

This was our last good act in my opinion. It stood out in such a strong year...I loved it so much. It was by a legendary boyband who reformed for Eurovision (and also inspired the diminished returns of Engelbert and Bonnie).

It was catchy in a year that stands out for catchiness with Jedward, Eric Saade, and Alexey Vorobyov rounding it off. It stood out and it was not too complicated or over the top. It was perfect and I fear with TAP tapping out (hahahaha I'm funny), we won't get to this height again.",1691407516.0,2023-08-07T21:25:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/15khxob/rankin_all_of_united_kingdom_acts_20072023/
Rankin'! All of Norway's Acts From 2007,15i434o,28,"Norway is one of those countries that you feel if they tried hard enough, they could win. They have only won 3 times, including once on this list.  

Welcome to my new piece Rankin' where I rank every major country from 2007 onwards, what I like to call the 'Re-Emergence' era.

All of the following is my opinion and meant for critisicm. No ill will against any of the acts here.

Just as a note, I will not be covering their entry in 2020. I would be comparing an edited and produced video against 16 live performances and I think that would be very unfair.

Now without further a do, the Rankin'!

16 - [Didrik Solli-Tangen - My Heart Is Yours (2010)](https://youtu.be/9w527tADNpc)

I cannot stand ballads. For me, a ballad has to be smooth and moving and I cannot move stuck in mud. That mud, is melancholy. It was sad. It was too lovey-dovey and I just did not gel with this song.

Didrik really brought his voice here but...no. The performance was nothing memorable and if I did not have to make this list, I would actually forget this song entirely.

15 - [Stella Mwangi - Haba Haba (2011)](https://youtu.be/cRhJzdDFFHA)

This was just a fusion that worked on paper...but not in principle. 

I liked the combo African beats and dancing, alongside the Europop melodies and catchy lyrics. But it just did not gel well. It felt off and just...

2011 was weak even in the semis holy shit.

[14 - Carl Espen - Silent Storm (2014)](https://youtu.be/BTMli8U17MM)

I. Do. Not. Like. Sad. Songs.

That being said, I really enjoy when acts come out by themself or with one or two back instruments. You have to have stage presence to pull this off. Unfortunately Carl did not.

His voice was strong but that was about it. He needed to focus his voice a little more and maybe this would be higher.

[13 - Mørland and Deborah Scarlett - A Monster Like Me (2015)](https://youtu.be/vY1FCXDojMU)

I DO NOT LIKE SAD SONGS!

The only reason this is so high is because I like duets. I'm probably the only one who enjoyed Running Scared here.

It did have a striking orange lighting thing going on and the closing verse and chorus really worked in the song. 

[12 - Jowst - Grab The Moment (2017)](https://youtu.be/U-Bk0PCotY0)

I...

Look. I'm not against electronic music. But this sounded like too many chefs in the kitchen. Is it a pop song? EDM? Dance? House? I genuinely could not tell and it took away from the song.

As did the visual effects on this song. It's not a bad song, just not one I can justify ranking any higher.

[11 - Maria - Hold On Be Strong (2008)](https://youtu.be/arSnpxfOD2k)

I did like this song, but the performance (and lyrics) were forgettable. I had to relisten to this song to rank it. Strong vocals and a beautiful song, if I could remember it more, it gets a top 10.

[10 - Alexander Rybak - That's How You Write A Song (2018)](https://youtu.be/N17BdRwOvBA)

Almost 10 years after his first appearance, Alex returned with a banger. I really, really enjoyed this song and it was so different to Fairytale. Which is why it ranks in the top 10. 

But it failed to capture that whimsy and magical effect Fairytale had. So that's why it is 10th.

[9 - Tooji - Stay (2012)](https://youtu.be/-ZaxIY1VAbM)

This had no right being last place in a grand final.

I really enjoyed this. Good dancing, catchy vocals, catchy lyrics, it was a solid song. We don't talk about the fact I'm biased because Tooji is good looking...

Anyway. 2012 was a decent year and this should out because it was catchy. So it gets a 9.

[8 - Guri Schanke - Ven A Bailar Conmigo (2007)](https://youtu.be/hNjMDNxNIr4)

A few fun facts with this song; Thomas G.Son, the writer who got Loreen a victory twice, also wrote this song. It was a fun, catchy song with a catchy chorus that may have slightly inspired Carlos Higes' 2023 Junior Eurovision Song Contest song, '[Señorita](https://youtu.be/uxPnSuDQQz8)'.

This song is not without fault - I completely forgot this song existed in terms of live performance. It needed something else to really stand out.

[7 - Tix - Fallen Angel (2021)](https://youtu.be/F0r3vmGLzZU)

This was something.

You either liked or loved this song and I was the former. It was nothing special, but a strong performance. I remember the angel getup clear as day. 

2021 was a VERY strong year, and I enjoyed this song for sure.

[6 - Agnette - Icebreaker (2016)](https://youtu.be/ACLcqZMwCSo)

How on Earth did this not qualify? This was a great pop ballad and one I stuck onto my playlist when I heard it. 

I do wish they did something to raise this high. It had the potential to be a grower.

[5 - Keiino - Spirit In The Sky (2019)](https://youtu.be/Ovt7YGHAj8I)

This year really marked the start of the Norwegian rise and Spirit On The Sky was the reason. Three different vocalists, catchy melody, hooky verse, hooky chorus - this should have won. It is my pick for 2019.

[4 - Alessandra - Queen of Kings (2023)](https://youtu.be/PUHSM_vTqTI)

I was not sure I would like this song. But I ended up loving it. It was minamilist in the style of 2009 Alexander Rybak in terms of dancing and staging. Her outfit was a little gimmicky and the dancers (especially the male dancers... especially the blonde one) looked really goofy and uncomfortable dancing in them.

But Alee looked really comfortable and confident performing this very catchy melody!

[3 - Subwoofer - Give That Wolf A Banana (2022)](https://youtu.be/adCU2rQyDeY)

I hate gimmick songs with a passion. But this was not gimmicky! It was fun, it was dancy, it was catchy, and honestly, I was really into it! I heard it brought a lot of furries into ESC too, which is great for inclusivity.

I personally think Subwoofer won't be returning. Their gimmick would be washed and I don't think they would have the success they achieved that year, if they did.

[2 - Margaret Burger - Feed Me Your Love (2013)](https://youtu.be/gjm-kCOMaPY)

One of only two acts (the other being Emmilie De Forrest) to stand out in 2013. This was a blast beginning to end. It was a dark pop song that could be a pop rock song if you wanted it to be.

Feed Me Your Love stood heads on shoulders on a weak year, and the song itself was impressive.

[1 - Alexander Rybak - Fairytale (2009)](https://youtu.be/WXwgZL4zx9o)

You knew it the moment you saw Norway!

You are joking if you believe anything other then Mr Rybak should be number one. I called this winning the night (my first ESC at 11 years old) and I was correct!

It was magical, it was classy, it was whimsy, and did not do too much. The dancers stayed far away from Alex to not take away from him or his violin. The background drop, stage lighting...we will never see another performance quite like this.",1691165118.0,2023-08-05T02:05:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/15i434o/rankin_all_of_norways_acts_from_2007/
Rankin'! Finland's Acts Since 2007,15g7580,37,"Finland came awfully close to winning this year's contest - the first time since 2006 and the second time ever. Finland have probably sent more rock and metal entries then any other country, and are probably my favourite country right now in ESC

Welcome to my new feature, Rankin'! I will be going over every major country's entries from the 'Re-Emergence of Eurovision' era (2007-). 

Please note, this is purely my tastes and not meant to be critical. If you feel I am being too harsh, comment below and I will rephrase. I mean no ill will towards any act.

I'm really looking forward to this one! I tend to skip past the non-qualifying acts, so this will be a nice listening expierence!!

**Please note, my mobile phone keyboard does not have access to certain Finnish letters. I am aware this will look like a typo, please deal with it as it is out of my control.**

**ALL RANKINGS SUBJECT TO CHANGE**

And on another note, I will not be covering 2020. It would be unfair to rank a polished, produced, and edited music video against live performances. I have considered using footage from the National Final or another live performance, but it would be detrimental towards that act.

So without further ado...here is my Rankin'!;

16 - Pernilla - När Jag Blunar (2012)

We start off with a non-qualifier and I think I know why.

This was a soft, sad song with no hooks, no memorable moments, and a performance that was forgetable as anything. I had to listen to all 16 songs back to back, and this was the only song I had to listen to again as I wrote this list.

Sorry Pernilla. It was just not my thing.

15 - Pertti Kurrikan Nimipäivät - Aina Mum Pitää (2015)

This was as far as I know, the shortest song in Eurovision history. It was less then 1 and a half minutes, and was a straight punk track. I do like punk but in a song this short, you have to bring something memorable.

And this was not that. There is no replay value here, and honestly? The sound mixing does no justice either. Sorry folks! I do feel sad as this marked Finland's 'dark age' in Eurovision, failing to qualify for the next few years.

14 - Norma John - Blackbird (2017)

This is an entry that should be higher but it goes with everything I hate about music...in the same year Salvador won by doing the same.

Nothing wrong with the song, I think it's better then Salvador to be honest. But the performance was not memorable and the lyrics were just...sad. it was sad for the sake of it. I hate when songs do that.

Great voice, just not for me.

13 - Kunnkuiskaajat - Työlki Ellää (2010)

I like folk music...when it's different. This sounded like it was pulled straight from Sound of Music. I like the sound and the minimalist stage production for this performance but it failed to stand out in a weak year, and failed to qualify.

12 - Sandhja - Sing It Away (2016)

I think this is the strongest performance in the 'Dark Era' of Finnish Eurovision, one of three songs straight not to qualify. It was a generic pop song with a memorable performance and catchy lyrics. 

Nothing too special and sometimes that works...in this case it did not, and it failed to qualify. I think it should have qualified, but 2016 was a particularly weak year. Not as weak as 2010, 2016, or 22, but still pretty weak.

11 - Darude - Look Away (2019)

Look...if the DJ who did 'Sandstorm' can't qualify for the grand final, I'm not sure what I can say about this performance. It was catchy, and had every bit of Darude you can think of.

It was not Sandstorm, but it was a very enjoyable song. 

10 - Sara Aalto - Monsters (2018)

The trendbreaker for the Finnish 'Dark Era' was a surprisingly good pop song. It stood out in one of the strongest years I can think of. Obviously, Netta won the contest but I had Sara near the top.

I don't particularly enjoy this style of pop, but I appreciated how it came across and I was shocked not many people thought the same.

9 - Waldo's People - Lose Control (2009)

I was expecting a cover but I got an original.

This was better then I thought it would be. Obviously I pegged Alexander Rybak as winner from the get go, but this was a stand out in the second strongest year I can think of.

What an awesome hippy pop song!

8 - Paradise Oskar - Da Da Dam (2011)

I love laid back songs. This was as laid back as it comes, and the messege about saving the planet was an additional plus. It set the tone for a particularly fun show and I really liked this entry.

It's a low placement because I can't replay the song that much, and the performance can be glanced over the other picks on this list.

7 - Krista Siegfrids - Marry Me (2013)

The highest pop song on this list. If you don't like rock and metal...you may leave now.

On a serious note, Krista Siegfrids tore down the show. She was my 2nd place behind Only Teardrops and the performance was extremely rememberable for the Vegas signing in the background and of course, the gay kiss at the end.

I love how Krista actively endorsed the LGBT community here, and the song was straight fire as well.

6 - Teräsbetoni - Missä miehet ratsastaa (2008)

I like metal. This was a fun metal track! Not really much in terms of replayability, or a rememberable performance, which is why it was left out from tje top 5 but this was a strong outing!

And now the top 5;

5 - Softengine - Something Better (2014)

Something Better was a typical 2010s rock track that really got me going. I really liked this track and it was one of my top tracks. But I can't remember the performance now I'm not listening to the song.

If they had a bit more pop...top 3 easily.

4 - Käärijä - Cha Cha Cha (2023)

This was my winner in 2023, and I was rooting for him so, so much. I love this song, it's one of my favourite releases of 2023 so far. But you can only listen to it so much before it starts to age.

The performance was memorable, but I feel you could have cut the rubbing around the box - you could see that tired him.

3 - Hanna Pakarinen - Leave Me Alone (2007)

From the get go, this song slaps. I can hear a lot of elements here used in modern metal songs and this is pretty old in comparison to most Eurovision songs. Now, I have not watched 2007. But this would be my winner from the acts I have seen.

Just two acts remaining!

2 - Blind Channel - Dark Side (2021)

Wow oh wow. This song hits so hard! 

I had this on repeat for weeks on end. Alongside Zitti E Buoni, these two songs dominated 2021 for me. It was dark, it was heavy, it was fun, and was just the epitome of what modern day metal should be about. 

It narrowly misses out because the performance was a tad bit weak for me. Could have had a little more pop. Little more bang.

1 - The Rasmus - Jezebel (2022)

How Finland produced two perfect entries in back to back years is beyond me.

Jezebel has the lyrics, the tone, the fun factor, the performance factor...I have been following The Rasmus for a while. In The Shadows is one of my favourite songs. So when Jezebel was announced I was estatic.

And it did not do too well, and I'm unsure why this was a top 3 song for me.",1690977912.0,2023-08-02T22:05:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/15g7580/rankin_finlands_acts_since_2007/
Rankin'!; Every Swedish Entry Since 2007!,15faoti,65,"Sweden are the kings once more.  Since 1999 the country has won 4 times, bringing their total victories to 7. They also hold one of only 2 two timers in history, meaning they share two records with rival Ireland.

Welcome to my new feature Rankin'! I will be ranking every major countries acts since 2007 (the start of what I call the 'Re-Emergence era'). All songs will be covered and I will list what I like and don't like about each one.

This is meant to be my thoughts and not a critical analysis - I harbour no ill will towards the contestants. If you feel like I'm being tough, comment below, I will try and reword what I said.

Another note; I will not be covering 2020. It will be unfair to rank 15 live performances against a polished, edited music video. I could use the Melodifestavelen footage, however I feel, again, this would be disadvantageous against them.

I will rank 2020 itself later.

But for now, my Rankin'!

**ALL RANKS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE**

16 - The Ark - The Worrying Kind (2007)

I wish I could put this higher as a rock fan but it was the cheesy shock rock style I can't get behind. It was also very glitzy, very glammy, in the same year Verka nearly win with a similar looking getup.

The lyrics were fun and the performance was top notch, I just can't put it any higher then last. It's not the worst rock act, but it is not the best either.

15 - Anna Bergendahl - This Is My Life (2010)

It speaks for itself when an act does not qualify. Given Sweden's impeccable record before this, Anna was the first Swedish NQ'er and so far, the only one.

This song was laid back and emotional, so far gone from what Sweden is known for. I liked the song! But the performance was sub par, and I feel like 2010 was a weak year in terms of songs, so it failed to stand out in that regard. Sorry Anna!

14 - Benjamin Ingrosso - Dance You Off (2018)

This...I was torn on. But I decided ultimately, I did not like it. It was catchy and dancey, but it did not have any memorable moments or hooks to let me replay it. I value replay factor a lot, and this had none of that.

It was the same verse over and over. The displays were catchy, but that was it. 

13 - Robin Sterjnberg - You (2013)

Originally, this was second to last, but it grew on me. This was the style of music that dominated the 2010s and turned me towards rock and metal. But on subsequent listens...it had a hook, it had a memorable performance, and a nice beat.

2013 was a weak year, again. Robin did not stand out, but he still had a few good points.

12 - Undo - Sanna Nielson (2014)

Strong ballad, strong vocals...just no replay factor! And I really enjoyed this song...it's so low because I cannot replay it!!

11 - Malana Ernman - La Voix (2009)

I'm a sucker for different music, and Malana brought different with a popera (pop opera) track. It was sweet, is was strong, but I felt her performance was dimmed by a lacklustre set.

Her long dress was elegant and stood out, and her music spoke for herself. I'm also a sucker for multiple language songs! But there are so many better Swedish songs.

10 - Cornelia Jacobs - Hold Me Closer (2022)

I love how 90s Cornelia is. From her short hair, to the clearly 90s inspired song. It was a strong pop ballad and I still believe Cornelia is one of the best vocalists Sweden has...but the song was not there. The performance was let down by a poor set.

I hope she gets to come to ESC again because I feel she can be a winner. But this was not that song, and not her night.

9 - Charlotte Perelli - Hero (2008)

When a former winner takes to the stage, I expect excellence. And I got that with Charlotte. I'm not sure why she was not a top 3 that year, but Dima Bilan was always going to be my winner. Charlotte was a close second.

I'm happy she performed so well, but in comparison to Take Me To Your Heaven, this does nothing for me.  Very shiny dress though!

8 - Robin Bengtsson - I Can't Go On (2017)

From his walk onto the stage in the backstage, to the treadmill dances...this was a string performance. The song lacked that 'oomph' for me to put it higher. It had no hook, but considering Robin Sterjnberg co-wrote it, I am not surprised.

2017 was dominated by one man, so to stand out whilst Salvador went for the throat, has some major plus points for me.

7 - Loreen - Euphoria (2012)

Time to get lynched.

Euphoria is one of Eurovisions biggest ever songs - the performance, the song, the 'I love you Baku' messege...there was nothing wrong with this song.

Then why have I ranked it 6th?

There are 5 better songs for me. I am so sorry Loreen. I really like this song, I really do! But this is mainly a personal preference situation.

6 - John Lundvik - Too Late For Love (2019)

This was a strong love ballad. I really liked it and John has a strong, one of a kind voice. It edges out Loreen but only just.

I feel like the performance of John was elevated by his backing singers. I felt like this was emotional and something John really wanted to do. 

5 - Tusse - Voices (2021)

This was...wow.

I was not sure what to expect when I first saw Tusse during the flag parade. But I was not expecting THIS! It was a very poignant and very strong, emotional performance. 

It might be recency bias but I really, really, really enjoyed this song.

4 - Frans - If I Was Sorry (2016)

People dislike this song. Some people really like it. I am of the later. For a 17 year old to come out and sing a relaxed, toned down ballad that quality is a hard task. I related to most the lyrics and Frans did a really good job finishing in the top 5.

It might have been boring to most, but I like the relaxed songs Eurovision brings. As long as they are just relaxed and not melancholic I can jive to it. And Frans, cracking job. Don't ever be sorry!

3 - Eric Saade - Popular (2011)

I friggin love this song! It's uptempo, it's replayable, it's cheesy...it's a friggin classic that I adore! Eric had some moves which esculates this for me to a top 3

2 - Loreen - Tattoo (2023)

Again, this might be recency bias. But I REALLY like this song! It's atmospheric, EDM-like and the performance was fantastic although I don't understand the need for stone nails...

Nontheless, Loreen set out to do what she wanted to do, and won. I was rooting for Cha Cha Cha, but as the months go on...Tattoo has so much more replability. It is an anthem and one of my favourite winners, looking back 

1 - Måns Zelmelöw - Heroes (2015)

The Hero of my time, Måns Zelmelöw produced a pop banger that I feel perfectly captures Eurovision. The performance was 10/10, the song was 10/10, and honestly, I really enjoyed this. I replay this song a lot, I keep coming back to it nearly 10 years later. 

It is for me...Swedish Supremecy.",1690891627.0,2023-08-01T22:07:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/15faoti/rankin_every_swedish_entry_since_2007/
Why Germany has failed at Eurovision in recent years - An analysis and opinion,15bioes,48,"Two and a half months after this year’s grand final and roughly one month before the start of the new Eurovision year (yay!), I think it‘s finally time to share my thoughts and opinion with you guys in this very detailed analysis about why my country Germany flops at Eurovision (almost) every year coming either last or second last and also some thoughts about the German broadcaster NDR. I hope it will give you an insight.

&#x200B;

First, let me provide some general information about NDR for those of you, who maybe don‘t know anything about it: To begin with, NDR, the German broadcaster responsible for selecting Germany's entry for Eurovision, is a state public service broadcaster and a part of ARD alongside ZDF and Deutschlandradio. So these three are our public broadcasters in Germany with ARD and ZDF being EBU members.

So basically, NDR is a „slice“ of the ARD-„cake“, whereas in other countries, the main TV stations are solely responsible for selecting their entry e.g. BBC in UK, YLE in Finland, TVP in Poland and so on.

&#x200B;

**The problematic organization of the national finals in 2016/2017/2019/2022:**

First, I‘d like to give you a recap of how it went in the past years:

\-  **2016**: the planned show *Unser Song für Xavier* was meant to select a song for Xavier Naidoo as Germany's representative. However, two days after his internal selection in November 2015, he was retracted as the choice due to extensive criticism. Xavier Naidoo was marred by controversies - he basically believes in any conspiracy theory you can think about such as denial of climate change or the existence of Covid (Seriously, what was NDR thinking?).

Many people back then were unsatisfied with NDR‘s decision and believed that he wasn‘t the right choice. Fortunately, NDR organized a national final, where people had the choice to vote for their favorite. Eventually, Jamie-Lee represented us in 2016 and came last.

\- **2017**: Although there wasn't a major scandal apart from some people accusing „Perfect Life“ to sound like „Titanium“, the show itself faced considerable disarray. The two potential Eurovision songs, ""Wildfire"" and ""Perfect Life,"" had already been internally pre-selected by NDR, leaving only the candidate to be chosen by the public.

The show's format involved several rounds of performances: In the 1st round, 5 candidates had to perform a song of their choice of which 2 candidates were eliminated. In the 2nd round, the 3 remaining candidates had to perform „Wildfire“, one candidate was eliminated and the choice was between Levina and Axel. The 3rd round was Levina and Axel performing „Perfect Life“ AND „Wildfire“ again (?), which resulted in Axel being eliminated. The 4th and final round was choosing between „Wildfire“ and „Perfect Life“, both performed by Levina. „Perfect Life“ won and Levina represented Germany in Kyiv, finishing 25th.

I‘d like to mention that there was also a jury in the 2017 show, but many were dissatisfied with them, as they appeared to merely provide opinions on performances without any substantial influence on the final choice. I mean, what‘s the point of having jury who has no say?

\- **2019**: After Michael Schulte's impressive 4th place in Lisbon, expectations were high. Hopes were raised that the infamous 25th/26th-curse might finally be broken. Unfortunately, that was not the case. At *Unser Song for Israel* Sisters were chosen to represent Germany in Tel Aviv. Unlike other candidates who participated in the songwriting camp similar to the 2018 selection process, Sisters already had a song and were selected via a wild card. Unfortunately, we faced a new low-point when Sisters received 0 points in the televoting, ultimately finishing 25th.

\- **2022**: Well, I think everyone here in this subreddit remembers the drama around Electric Callboy and how stubborn NDR has been. I believe that this was a slap in the face for every German fan. First, no one really knew what was going to happen in 2022. Yet another internal selection by NDR? Going back to doing a song writing camp with artists and having a show with former Eurovision jurors/artists? Maybe selecting Electric Callboy who expressed their interest in representing us in Turin, which many fans supported?

Nope, it was even worse: We were given probably the worst national final EVER called *Germany 12 points*. The title itself seemed ironic, given the disappointing outcome, with Germany receiving only 6 points in the Grand Final. The selection of radio-friendly songs for Eurovision proved unsuccessful, resulting in yet another last-place. When the songs were presented to us, honestly, I felt fooled by NDR. Seriously. I was speechless. NDR yet again thought, their new concept would work. It didn‘t.

\- **2023**: Well, a silver lining it seemed. NDR had learned from its past mistake and gave us *Unser Lied für Liverpool*. I have to give kudos to NDR. There was even a Tiktok wild card selection and we had entries of many different genres with jurors from different countries and a German televoting. We choose Lord of the Lost as our representative for Liverpool. Sadly, we‘d come last again. This time however, it wasn‘t necessarily the fault of NDR.

Now that all of the above has been mentioned, what is the actual problem? It becomes apparent that there is a pattern of inconsistency in Germany's Eurovision selection process. Each year, a different approach was taken.

In contrast, countries like Sweden, with the long-standing Melodifestivalen, or Norway with MGP,  have maintained consistent and well-established selection concepts over the years. Melfest has undergone minor changes (introduction of age groups voting) but the core concept has remained stable.

NDR however, decided to change the concept almost every year thinking Germany would be more successful instead of focusing on the artists and songs. And this leads me to my next point:

&#x200B;

**The actual songs and artists:**

Let me talk about the actual songs a bit and the artists (**Disclaimer: The intention behind mentioning any names or artists is not to bash or disrespect any of them; rather, I aim to discuss the songs and artists objectively)**

\- **2016**: I remember, Jamie-Lee was kind of our hope for Stockholm. When I look back and rewatch her performance, I simply don‘t think that it was a good song for Eurovision. I believe, she was popular among younger fans, as she just had won The Voice of Germany. There was a certain hype around her and her appearance. While I think that Jamie-Lee is a fantastic performer, the song „Ghost“ was not aimed at the European audience but rather a younger audience and teens.

\- **2017**: Again, after a disappointing last place in 2016, NDR decided to change the process of selecting the song In 2017. I think that the reason for finishing 25th wasn‘t the artist Levina herself but rather her song. “Perfect Life“ was accused to sound like„Titanium“ by David Guetta. An online music magazine called *laut**.de* went even further and called the song a *shallow* and *interchangable* David Guetta & Sia *knock-off.*

I simply think that the song was very basic radio pop and again not aimed at a bigger international audience. It‘s an okay song to listen to on the radio, but not something I wanna hear on an international stage. I also believe, NDR thought the song would succeed because one of the song writers of  „Perfect Life“ was Lindy Robbins, who indeed wrote number-one-hits.

\- **2019**: I don‘t really have much more to say, only that I believe, the lyrics of the song „Sister“ didn‘t benefit the duo and their performance in Tel Aviv was not harmonic at all. Again, the song itself was okay, but it wasn‘t made for the big stage.

\- **2022**: So Malik Harris was chosen. I have to say, from the 6 radio-friendly songs, where we basically had the choice between the devil and the deep blue sea, I think „Rockstars“ was still the best option. Again, in my opinion, the song didn‘t work on stage in Turin, I believe, it is more a song, I‘d listen to on Spotify and truely enjoy (the lyrics are really beautiful tbh). I do however feel sorry for Malik that he had to go through the entire drama where everyone was hoping for Electric Callboy.

\- **2023**: Well, woran hat‘s gelegen? (*What was the reason?*) I believe, the choice of the song title ""Blood & Glitter"" might not have been the most suitable given the current situation in Ukraine. The term ""Blood"" can indeed carry negative connotations and may have created unintended associations for some viewers. Additionally, the possibility of people confusing ""Lord"" with Lordi from Finland could have added to the drama.

Moreover, having numerous standout entries, LotL might not have been able to stand out enough to capture the attention of voters. Countries like Australia, Finland, Croatia, or Slovenia had ""heavier"" songs too. Also, another reason could be that a lot of songs in the televoting had to be sacrificed for CCC/QoK/Tattoo considering that Austria too received a low score despite being one of the fan favorites.

So, to sum it up, are „Perfect Life“, „Ghost“, „Rockstars“ „Blood & Glitters“ bad songs? No. They are simply well-produced songs but targeting the wrong audience. Remember that an artist has only 3 minutes on stage to woo the audience. There is no „Maybe the song will grow on them“ in the grand final, you have to satisfy the televoters **within** those 3 minutes.

&#x200B;

**NDR‘s internal selection in 2021:**

In 2021, NDR decided to select the German entry internally without letting the public have a say. The song „I don’t feel hate“ by Jendrik was yet another radio-friendly song and it seemed, NDR kinda insisted on giving us something *unusual* and *silly*. Unfortunately, it didn’t work. And NDR changing the concept and style YET again didn‘t help either.

I don‘t think that an internal selection is necessarily bad but unfortunately, NDR couldn‘t handle it professionally. After the cancellation of the 2020 contest, many German fans were puzzled, how NDR would handle the situation. Basically, we didn‘t know anything for weeks. At the last moment, NDR announced an internal selection and we would have to deal with it.

Was IDFH a bad song? No. Again, it simply wasn’t a song intended for Eurovision. It wasn‘t a song that would work on the big stage in front of a big audience.

&#x200B;

**Why Germany was so successful in 2018:**

So what about 2018 when Germany came 4th? A simple explanation:  „You let me walk alone“ was a very personal song about Michael‘s father and his family and was simply made for him and you could really feel the message on stage. Also don‘t forget the visuals. An additional bonus was probably Michael being Danish. Germany received 24 points from Denmark.

Thanks to the songwriting camp, we had a fantastic national final. The focus was on writing the songs with the artists. Also, this time, Barbara didn‘t host the show so Elton and Linda Zervakis jumped in.

&#x200B;

**Summary and outlook:**

To sum it up, NDR simply failed to give us a proper national final without a concept that would work. The focus was mostly „the fancier, the better“ without focusing enough on the artists and the songs. All attempts (except 2018) failed.

Do we need a big national final with semi finals like Melfest? No. We need a well-thought-out concept with a proper structure and selection and proper song writing. Were our past entries bad? Nope. They simply weren’t Eurovision-enough. Did Malik Harris, Jamie-Lee, LotL etc. deserve last place? Absolutely not. All of them deserve to have a successful career as artists.

What else can be said? Well, Personally, I wouldn't mind if Germany didn't participate for one or more years. Some even say, Barbara shouldn‘t be involved at Eurovision-related shows every year. I agree. Don‘t get me wrong, Barbara is a fantastic TV presenter and I like her but I think after 8 years, it‘s time for her to step down and make room for someone new.

&#x200B;

In my personal opinion, NDR needs a breath of fresh air. They need to re-evaluate their concept thoroughly and the main focus should be the right chemistry between the song and the artist and understanding, how Eurovision actually works. That’s how we could lift the 25th/26th-curse again.

Every year presents new opportunities and Germany can find its path to success in the contest once again.

Is Eurovision in a Renaissance era? Golden age?,15b9pf3,50,"Eurovision has been such a long lasting show with up and downs in viewing and cultural relevance, but I think its undeniable that the show might be its most relevant around the world as of now, but that is highly debatable. So my discussion question is what era is eurovision in right now and what do we think some of the eras were.

Personally,
I would say like 2001-2009 was like a golden age, 2010 - 2013 with the exception of loreen were im my opinion not as impactful as 2014, where we had some major moments, and even more major moments in 2015 and 2016",1690483143.0,2023-07-28T04:39:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/15b9pf3/is_eurovision_in_a_renaissance_era_golden_age/

"Unless I am mistaken, Måns has appeared in more Eurovisions then any former contestant",14yr7pt,76,"2015 - he competed and won with 'Heroes' (possibly one of my top 5 all time ESC wins)

2016 - he hosted in Stockholm alongside Petra Mede, and performed three songs (one being Heroes, one being a new release, and one alongside Petra Mede)

2017 - he taught the Ukrainian hosts how to be the perfect ESC host in one of my favourite skits

2018 - he skipped ESC, however he did host the UK National Final alongside our national treasure, Mel Giedroyc.

2019 - he was part of the Switch Song segment in Tel Aviv, where he performed Eleni Foureira's 'Fuego'

2020 - he performed during the replacement to the contest, Shine A Light 

2021 - he once again, permored Heroes as part of the Eurovision Rooftop Party

2023 - he also performed with Filomena Cautela during one of the semis this year.

He also provided commentary for the Swedes in 2023.

So that is 7 contests he has had a hand in, 8 if you account his UK appearance! That is an insane amount, I'm not sure there is another performer who has had more appearances except maybe Verka (?).",1689269991.0,2023-07-14T03:39:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/14yr7pt/unless_i_am_mistaken_måns_has_appeared_in_more/
Ranking of Australian Eurovision Entries,14sorpj,11,"Because Australia doesn't have 12 Eurovision Entries to do in the Eurovision scoring system I'm going to do this in an old Formula 1 points system, it will make sense as I go on

If this ends up being Australia's last year this year if the contract with EBU isn't renewed, I'd like to rank everything they've sent so far with a small explanation as to my reasoning behind each decision

10 points> 2016- Dami Im Sound of Silence, such a perfectly delivered power ballad, as a small nitpick the staging could have been a little better in the verses but otherwise the song and staging are pretty much perfection for me and Dami Im is a phenomenal singer

8 points> 2023- Voyager Promise, in 3 minutes it packs so much into a song in a number of areas, for me in particular the ending after the keyboard solo is brilliant

6 points> 2022- Sheldon Riley Not The Same, I feel bad for Sheldon, he was in a death spot between Sweden and the UK but the vocal performance was absolutely amazing and his mask reveal for me was iconic

5 points> 2019- Kate Miller Heidke Zero Gravity, I think as a song it doesn't offer too much, it is a thin song but Kate delivers a brilliant vocal performance and the staging is iconic

4 points> 2020- Montaigne Don't Break Me. it's hard to judge this totally because 2020 Eurovision didn't happen but Montaigne comes across really strong in performance and I like their look, backing dancers and staging

3 points> 2015- Guy Sebastian Tonight Again, it's a bit basic but it is a good start for an Australian entry in Eurovision and Guy performs it well, the staging is well done which helps Guy aswell

2 points> 2021- Montagine Techicolour, I like this song but I don't think it totally works for Eurovision, plus the staging is just too much and the lack of live performance in the semi final in front of an audience hurts it, it falls a bit flat as a result

1 point> 2018- Jessica Mauboy We Got Love, it's quite a basic song and arguably outdated for Eurovision in 2018 but she does perform it decently and clearly happy to be there

0 points> 2017- Isaiah Don't Come Easy, I've never connected with the song or with Isaiah, the vocals are so hit-and-miss, plus I find it quite self-indulgent and the staging a mix of off-putting or bland",1688684176.0,2023-07-07T08:56:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/14sorpj/ranking_of_australian_eurovision_entries/
The fandom should create the Australia's Curse.,14sejzk,7,"I think the Eurovision ""fandom"" should create the Australia's curse. (Like the Albina's Curse).

&#x200B;

The Australia's curse consists of a country doing VERY WELL in the semi-final, and then having a bad result in the Grand Final. Or the opposite, do very badly in the semi-final, qualify, and then in the Grand Final do very well.

&#x200B;

Why the name ""Australia's curse""?

Very simple, since Australia entered Eurovision, almost (almost all, not all) entries have either done well in SF and terrible in GF or done badly in SF and then well in GF.

Evidence:

Year | P. SF | P. GF

How I would do ESC 2024 Production Wise.,14pwqdq,4,"**The following is all my own article, and I am not affiliated with the European Broadcasting Union or the partnered broadcasting company in charge of the event, in this case, SVT.**

[I was inspired by this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/14ptqgz/what_opening_and_interval_acts_are_you_expecting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2) to write this article. The simple question 'What Interval And Opening Acts Would You Like To See?' made my brain salivate in creative ideas for the tournament.

With that said, please note this is all my own content and I am not working with SVT. They will be in charge of this event, not me.

**The Opening:**

This was sort of difficult to setup as I am not too clued up in Swedish culture outside of Eurovision. But in 2012 and 2016, Sweden had no opener as such. It went straight into the flag parade. So I want to do that.

**The Hosts:**

Petra Mede will return for the third time. She will be joined by Farah Abadi. Again, I'm not too clued up with hosts of Sweden but Petra is a Eurovision icon, and Farah did well in this year's Melodi.

**Theme:**
*'music for everybody'*. Music should be for everyone. Be you someone who hates rock, or hates pop, music should be available for everyone to enjoy. 

**Postcards:**

This year I wanted to try something different with the postcards - the spokespeople don't really get to be known by the countries. So to prevent vote fixing, I would have the spokespeople from last year (or, someone from the team last year, who is not on the spokespeople team this year), meet the delegation from the countries, and do an event together.

**Interval 1**

Loreen won last year, so as is Eurovision tradition, she performs Tattoo and possibly a new single. I'm avoiding Euphoria here. That will play into the second interval act.

**Interval 2 - Swedish Legacy in Eurovision**

Now for the big interval act!

Glass shatters on the stage, and smoke fills the arena. Once it clears, we see Eric Saade. Dancers quickly join him for the criminally underrated 'Popular' from 2011. Towards the end of his performance he drops down and the lights turn off.

As they turn on, Sanna Nielson is standing at the stage, and performs Undo. As the song ends, Robin Sterjnberg is lowered onto the stage to perform ""You"", and after Robin, Cornelia performs 'Hold Me Closer'. The lights then go out completely...

On the screens behind them, we see a recap of 1999 Eurovision Song Contest, and Charlotte Perelli hoisting the trophy. She then performs 'Take Me To Your Heaven', before belting out 'Hero'. The lights then fade once more and we see the following messege...

*When one Hero is not enough...*

An army of little stickmen from the Heroes performance in 2015 flood the screens as Mäns Zelmelöw performs Heroes, and then Charlotte replaces Petra for Love Love, Kiss Kiss, which Robin, Sanna, and Eric all join in for.

We then hear the first 15 seconds of 'Euphoria'. But Loreen is not joining us...yet. John Lundvik performs 'Too Late For Love', and then the lights go out once again.

We get a voice clip of every 12 points ever towards Sweden. And then we get a voice clip from Bjorn from ABBA.

*""Ladies and Gentlemen, your second time Eurovision two time champion - Loreen!""*

Euphoria is then played, and Loreen sings the first few 'Euphora's and then the music stops. John, Mäns, and Charlotte all reappear and perform Waterloo 50 years later, and are joined by all the acts this year on stage, and intercuts into Mamma Mia! Before finally, we get the last part of Euphoria, and the confetti bursta over the stage. And as a final Easter egg, Loreen and Johnny Logan, go face to face...and hug. Aww.",1688422644.0,2023-07-04T08:17:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/14pwqdq/how_i_would_do_esc_2024_production_wise/
"Thought on artists brought to together to represent at Eurovision (supergroups, per se)",14noxs0,28,"This was a shower thought. There're times when two are more individual artists with their own discographies are brought together to represent a country, either by invitation of one party to the other or teaming up for that song. How do people perceive these types of situations? I want to hear other people's opinions about this because I have mine.

The first example I think about is Dave Benton and Tanel Padar who were brought together for Eurovision representing Estonia in 2001, and won, but the duo didn't continue anything together due to conflict between them and their separate managements (if I'm recalling correctly) and only met up again after the contest for Eurovision 2002.

The next two are the supergroups of the 21st century: Genealogy and Equinox. Genealogy were brought together for Armenia's participation in 2015 coinciding with Armenia's 100 year anniversary of the genocide, and that's that; they weren't expected to do anything together after. However, Equinox were brought together in 2018 for Bulgaria, actually signed with Universal for their activities, but released nothing after Eurovision 5 years since.

The next examples are from this year, actually: Dion & Mia, and Teya & Salena. This is the reason why I had the shower thought, and shows that these types of situations can either be a collaboration or a collision. It's a sad situation for Dion & Mia because they had a sufficient song, but don't have equal live performance and vocal skills, so it was painfully obvious who became the main character after the key change for SF 1. Teya & Salena are friends before Eurovision, and this is probably one of the few times were they decided together to submit a song (rather than a third part deciding who to put who together, or being invited to fill part in the song), so they meshed well together, have strong vocals live, and knew what the song intends on doing.

What do people think about these situations? Personally, for me, I do enjoy when a temporary unit's members fulfill their dream together, especially when they're friends like Teya and Salena. But honestly, it can get a bit hectic after Eurovision because now people support Teya and Salena separately because of their own music ventures/styles rather than a unit. Like, to find out what Teya and Salena are doing, you have to check their individual social medias, and for me, that can get overwhelming (and maybe that's just me). It's also a bit bitter knowing that these types of situation don't always end up well. Dion and Mia are probably still friends behind social media, but Dave and Tanel prove that very well. And we have to talk about Equinox because signing up with Universal and doing nothing after the fact probably means they couldn't agree to the actual promotional practices or they're in denial that they couldn't agree on something, so they ""quietly"" disbanded by saying that all members will continue on their solo ventures waiting for the contract to expire (Teya and Salena would say they didn't want to be stars).

So I guess my thoughts are a type of ""oh yay, oh no"" type of reaction, to nutshell this messily written post at 4 AM.",1688197252.0,2023-07-01T17:40:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/14noxs0/thought_on_artists_brought_to_together_to/
The Undisputed King of Pop - Sweeden At Eurovision,14hf8nb,15,"**Please note, the following article is my own. Whilst I researched all this on my own some information may be inaccurate. I appreciate if you inform me of any mistakes in a respectable manner**

**I also understand there are a few spelling mistakes - I believe in clear work process, and not dwindling on small mistakes. If you see a spelling error, please ask as I will not be correcting them unless it makes zero sense.**

Since the early days of Eurovision, Sweden have dominated. In fact, Sweden have been so supreme, their only non-qualifying performance was in 2010. And since 2004, only 6 acts have failed to reach the top 10.

What's even more impressive? Since 2000, 11 acts have been in the top 5. And since 2009, 5 have had a pedestal position, with 3 winning outright - including Eurovisions second 2-time champion in Loreen both in 2012 and 11 years later, in 2023.

You could argue Ireland were the closest thing they had to a rival, but since the early 2000s, Ireland has dropped off significantly whilst Sweden has only gotten better.

In 1995 and 1996, Jan Johansen and One More Time both finished third in their respective contest and both finished with 100 points. In 1999 Charlotte Nilsson won with 163 points, and a unanimous favourite to win the tournament.

Charlotte was a little bit of a curse - for the next 10 years, Sweden failed to crack the top 3 but in 2001, 3, 4, and 6, they did place in the top 5. The consistency of this country is incredible. But in 2010, disaster struck as for the first time in Sweden's history, they failed to qualify.

Anna Bergendahl went to ESC with a ballad. She was the first contestant since the 1990s to win Melodifestavelen - the Swedish national final - with a ballard. This is highly unusual, as Sweden typically send a pop act.

But in 2011, they came back with a bang. Eric Staal sent 'Popular' to ESC. Never considered a winning track, it was predicted to do well. He placed third, in the combined voting era, with only two 12 point votes. The jury punished the track hard, but the public loved this earworm.

And in 2012, Loreen happened. What is quite possibly one of the best Eurovision songs ever released, Euphoria set records. At the time, Loreen became the 2nd highest point total in history behind Alexander Rybak only 3 years prior.

Whilst Loreen set records, Robin Sterjnberg did not and in 2013, he finished outside the top 10. But from 2014 through to 2021...Sweden never fell out of the top 10. In 2014, Sanna Nielson became the second highest Swedish artist behind Loreen, and in 2015, Måns Selmerlöw won for the third time since 1999.

And since 2015, Sweden have been incredible. Only in 2021, have they dropped in quality, finishing below the top 10. 

In 2023, Loreen became the second two-timer and the first woman to do it. Tattoo got 5 million listens the day of the final on Spotify, making her the most prolific artist on day one in Swedish history. She became the first artist since the 1990s to spend more then 2 weeks inside the top 5 songs in the UK, solidifying her as one of - if not the - biggest star Sweden has produced since ABBA.

She even lost the popularity vote to Finland by a huge margin. But the jury vote loved her, and she rode that to a victory.

Want another fantastic stat? Since 1999, the average position of Sweden (when they qualify) sits at 6.75 - rounded up to a whole number, Sweden finish comfortably at 7 on average. This is the highest average for a partaking country since 1999.

Sweden are the kings of modern day pop. There is a reason why Anna Bergendahl failed in 2010 - the systematic approach the Sweeds put into their pop production is unprecedented in the west. Besides the pop juggernauts in the east (Korea, Japan, and China to be exact), there really is no other country with the dedication to pop music.

Which is also a double edged sword. In 2010, Sweden experimented from a sound they knew they were good at. Whilst it was not a bad song, Swedish pop has a certain gravitas and mark of excellence about it that is unrivalled in the country.

There will never be another country that leaves such a recognisable mark on the pop genre in Eurovision.
