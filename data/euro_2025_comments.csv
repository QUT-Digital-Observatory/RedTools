JochCool,"I have a personal dislike for this. Flairs are shown right below your name on every single post or comment you make, making it feel a bit like it is part of your identity. It would make me much more conscious than I am now about which single song to pick as my favourite, even though the main reason why I enjoy Eurovision is that you get to hear and enjoy lots of different music from lots of countries. Maybe I would use it if I could pick multiple songs for my flair somehow, but then I'd probably stuff it with lots of them lol.

I'm probably in the minority here though, given how many people spam their rankings online (but even then you get to show your support for lots of songs, not just one).

Btw, if people are personally attacking others based on their nationality, maybe deal with those people then? Because that's never okay.",lkygezj,1725176170.0,2024-09-01T17:36:10,t3_1f60lvx,t3_1f60lvx,"['lkymvbc', 'll03ag5', 'll0hdwk', 'll8amz6']",4

PraetorIt,"Strongly disagree. I think it's a confusing choice, which affects a peaceful choices of users, rather than the harassing behaviors.

The original idea of ​​the flair was another, but if the eurofans have chosen to use it differently, there's nothing wrong with it. It happens. Moreover, it's not even relevant to the issue. As you yourselves wrote, harrassment will still happen, because the cause isn't the flair, but the way people think and the polarization on certain topics (e.g. if an user indicates an Israeli song as a favorite, reprehensible behavior will still happen). So what's the point?

It seems to me that it serves to support the original idea for the ​​flairs, instead of the use of flair to express the origin of the user. However, this isn't the problem for the sub. Among others, it's consistent with the ESC's idea of ​​representing the diversity of people (and Europa). So users should be free to continue do so, and certainly not 'deprecated'.",lkzdf13,1725195664.0,2024-09-01T23:01:04,t3_1f60lvx,t3_1f60lvx,[],0

odajoana,"Honestly, me too. It gave perspective on why and how certain people here perceive Eurovision and where their points of view come from, given how different Eurovision's reputation is in each country and how the show is approached by each broadcaster.

But if removing the country of origin helps fight harassment, then I'm all for it.

I wonder if there could be an option of having two flags in the flair, like ""[country of origin] -> [country supported in any given year]"". You could use the regular flag icon for the country of origin and the heart-shaped icon for the supported country, for instance. I think /r/AskEurope uses something like it to showcase people's country of origin and country they're living in at the moment.

Just an idea.

EDIT: It would also remove the spam of the name of the songs in the flairs, I mean, I know it's an exception, but dear lord, Estonia's song title in the flair from this year occupies half my screen.

diligentfalconry71,"I agree. This is really confounding for me, because I don’t have single favorite songs. I try to go in to the semis somewhat unspoiled (I don’t avoid radio so I do hear some things, but I don’t watch the NFs or go out of my way to hear what everyone is sending), and I always treat my votes as a pool that I hand out to usually like half the participants in a semi and at least half a dozen for every final. I don’t have an all time favorite. 

And from that perspective, I kinda don’t like the team sports angle of the whole community slapping the name of one single song on their virtual foreheads, and losing the more sort of global community of using flairs to see where folks come from. Plus I kind of liked the ambiguity of not immediately knowing if the flair was for location or support.

Ylirio,"Fair points

We can do both, so giving people the choice to either show a country flair or a song flair. Combining both into one Im not a fan of, not sure how it would work either.  

I had my doubts about nendest as well. Many different platforms to use reddit on so hard to check them all how it is handled. For me my 3rd party app truncates it automatically. Doesn't look too intrusive on the official app either.  

Are you suggesting to just put the year there instead of the song title? I think song titles gives flairs a bit more.. flair, which you lose with just the years.

I have no idea how /r/AskEurope does it, but their flairs are HIGHLY customizable. People can choose several flags, they can write the name of the country, they can write whatever, it seems. 

Here's a screenshot of one of their threads to showcase how their flairs look to me.

I'm not saying it should be this convoluted, but a concept like this would be great, in my opinion.

Like I said, I think it would be nice to have the regular (rectangular) flag icon to designate country of origin, and then the heart-shaped flag to designate the country we're supporting. And if people don't want to include country of origin, they would just keep the heart-shaped one to show their love for that country (and likewise, if people don't want to show support for a specific country but want to keep their country of origin, they'd choose the rectangular flag icon only).",lkzecmn,1725196039.0,2024-09-01T23:07:19,t3_1f60lvx,t1_lkx2l65,[],0

DonnaDonna1973,"First wave ticket sales on the first day they‘re released is usually a big messy gamble, for any show on offer, because it’s just everyone and their pet hamster queuing up.
It’s worth doing however, bring time & patience & preferably 2 or 3 laptops logged in, because if you want at least a chance of scoring *good seating* and safely early, you’ll need to face the onslaught.

However, there’s always chances with resales, be on the lookout for those often but getting lucky late isn’t *that* rare. We got our Semi Live tix way in advance but got lucky right when in Malmö with GF resale tickets, *on Friday morning*!

Personally, I think getting Semi Live tickets is a bit easier and I love the combo of watching at least one Semi live in the arena and then doing a public viewing of the GF somewhere in the host city (Basel should be great if they pull off the huge public viewing in the adjacent stadium!) because it’s just great to see the show as it’s meant to be as a TV show, as it is great to see it on location, which a is equally great but wholly different.",lkyur5r,1725185769.0,2024-09-01T20:16:09,t3_1f506us,t3_1f506us,"['ll222wq', 'll2jcuv']",2

2. Be persistent. Tickets get held for 10-15 min in the queue so after the wave of people give up thinking it is sold out, a few randomly appear hours or days later.
3. Be on the lookout almost daily for resale tickets.
4. Be on the lookout for 2nd and 3rd wave releases of tickets.
5. Keep checking daily in the ticket system about one month out for people who can't go anymore if you haven't been successful at that point.

curiossceptic,"A few possible reasons: i) while offered budgets of the cities were similar the distribution of money was different, Basel and Geneva's budget included positions to directly cover costs of the Swiss TV broadcaster, and not only to cover the organization of the event. Zurich and Bern did not offer such direct payments. ii) The Swiss TV broadcaster for the German-speaking parts is constantly accused of favoring Zurich or being Zurich-focused, where they are based.  iii) risk of a referendum/vote against the budget did exist in Zurich, even though chances that it would have been successful were basically inexistent.

In particular for points i and ii important context is the political climate: there is a political proposal that wants to cut funding to the public broadcaster and there will most likely be a vote on that in the next year or so (they have collected enough signatures already).

For anyone else confused: editions and anniversaries are two different things. Anniversaries count how many years it's been since something (first) happened, like a wedding anniversary, a tragedy or disaster, or in this case a contest. Esc will thus celebrate its 70th anniversary in 2026.

Editions, though, count the amount of times something has happened. Because we don't usually start counting at 0, this means yearly editions will always be one year ahead of anniversaries - since you start at 1, the *first anniversary* will see the *second contest* held, etc.

So while 2026 will be the 70th anniversary, it was supposed to have been the 71st edition of the contest. However, due to covid, the edition has caught up with the anniversaries.

I’ve had similar experiences and witnessed loved ones, too, losing weight due to mental struggles, stress, and borderline abusing their bodies - yet people kept telling them how great and healthy they looked.

~~Czechia and~~ The Netherlands will probably withdraw, but nothing is certain.

We have no information that Hungary, Monaco, Macedonia, Morocco, or Romania are planning on returning.

Seeing as how Liechtenstein lacks a television broadcaster, it could not participate even if it wanted to.

Edit: So a high ranking employee of the Czech broadcaster just posted on the official ESC discord saying ""Should Czechia compete and finally win it?', so maybe we should second guess the idea that Czechia is withdrawing.

snwlss,"I’m a bit surprised at the number that haven’t made a decision yet, although I should mention that Liechtenstein is technically not eligible to compete, as they don’t yet have an EBU member station.  (Their national radio broadcaster is making an attempt to apply, but as far as I know, there’s never been a country made an EBU member with only a radio station in the Modern Eurovision Era.  I could be wrong, though, so please don’t come after me with glittery machetes. 😂)

My gut, though, is telling me that most of the “Undecided” column will end up participating with the exceptions of:

* **Bulgaria**:  Hasn’t participated in a couple of years and I don’t know if they’ve made any signs of indicating a return.    
* **Hungary**: I don’t expect to make a return for as long as the current government under Orbán is still in power.  (Similar situation to Türkiye.)    
* **Netherlands**: I fully expect the Netherlands to sit out for at least this upcoming Contest to make a statement to the EBU about their treatment of Joost.    

I think North Macedonia, Romania, and Monaco are all possibilities to return.  North Macedonia seems to be the strongest possibility to return as they were rumored to be doing so in the lead up to Eurovision 2024 with the leak of some budgetary plans, but ended up sitting out.  (And they’ve still taken part in Junior Eurovision during their hiatus from the main competition.)  Monaco seems to have been taking the necessary steps towards a return, and with their EBU member station having had that status for a year now, I have a feeling it’s not a matter of *if* they’ll return, but *when*.

with all the joost klein drama and the ebu handing it horribly, along with AVROTROS and nikkie withdrawing from calling points, it’s definitely not going to happen.

what’s more likely (and is what people think is going to happen) is that joost gets sent to perform for belgium. 

belgium is already a country with a majority of people speaking dutch/flemish, so he could easily just perform in dutch again.

honestly i wouldn’t blame AVROTROS for withdrawing next year, but if the ebu decide to change israel’s participation status (like russia and belarus) then i think they would be open to do it again (the joost klein drama was with an israeli reporter).

Chronicbias,"AVROTROS: 'Eurovision organization takes objections seriously, participation in 2025 still uncertain'  

AVROTROS and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) have already had cautious contact in the run-up to their conversation. The Eurovision Song Contest organizer has indicated that it will take all objections from the broadcaster seriously.  

A spokesperson for AVROTROS emphasizes that the broadcaster has not yet made a decision about participation in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2025. ""All options are still on the table,"" the spokesperson said. The registration deadline is mid-September.

AVROTROS and NPO will speak with a delegation from the EBU at short notice. The disqualification of Joost Klein is central and the broadcaster also wants to discuss all objections about the course of events behind the scenes. AVROTROS previously sent the European broadcasting organization an extensive letter of objection about this, which remained unanswered. The EBU has now indicated that it will provide answers quickly.

The Eurovision Song Contest organizer promised improvements at the beginning of July after an independent investigation into the last edition was conducted. AVROTROS said at the time that it was pleased that 'serious recommendations' had been made 'to examine the entire organisation, the rules of the game and the well-being of the artists at the Eurovision Song Contest'.

The investigation was launched after several delegations expressed harsh criticism of the atmosphere behind the scenes.

The investigation into Joost Klein was stopped due to lack of evidence. Aran Bade spoke out about the situation.

Nick_esc,"Translation: 

After a break of two years, Montenegro will have its own representative at Eurovision 2025. RTCG Announces a public competition for the selection of a composition for the representative of Montenegro and RTCG at the international competition Eurovision Song Contest 2025.
 
In order to develop and improve musical creativity in the field of popular music, Public Media Service RTCG organizes the selection of representatives of Montenegro for the international competition “Eurovision Song Contest 2025”, which will be held in May 2025 in Switzerland, organized by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU)


The selection of the composition that will represent Montenegro and RTCG at the contest “Eurovision Song 2025” will take place at the competition, i.e. the festival called “Montesong 2024”.

The selection of the composition that will represent Montenegro and RTCG at the contest “Eurovision Song 2025” will be decided, on the one hand, by the votes of the expert jury, composed of eminent music and media creators, as well as representatives of organizations and associations of citizens involved in monitoring the Eurovision Song Contest, and on the other hand foreign voices of the audience, i.e. citizens of Montenegro. The ratio of votes is determined according to the Eurovision principle - 50% of the jury and 50% of the audience (that is, about 50% due to the rounding of the number in percentages).

The composition that will have the highest number of votes from the expert jury and the audience will be the representative of Montenegro and RTCG at the “Eurovision Song 2025” competition.",li7bid2,1723705219.0,2024-08-15T17:00:19,t3_1esonsu,t3_1esonsu,"['li7bqf7', 'li7cqvh', 'li7dkso', 'liaeisz', 'li7gjca', 'li7ftgh']",6

Also, this comment on the site just shows our confidence and bitter truth:

""We quickly forgot our previous participation in EUROSONG. Every year, a group of musical masters would convince us that we are a ""musical nation"" and that the prepared songs, through the selection, will surely stand out for their quality, and that we have great chances with it. , if not for victory, at least for a high ranking, which will determine Montenegrin universality. And usually, after a big crash, composers and jury members would share 300,000-400,000 euros of state money, after which they would calm down until the next Eurosong. and then the same people appear, with the conviction of ""musical Montenegrins"", that we are ready for a big surprise. And so for years, we filled our pockets with state money. In the end, let's say we win, which is in the realm of the impossible, the question now is: how to organize such glamor and how much will it cost? but that is not important. the important thing is that the same fiddlers will ""gild"" it all and that this year the fiddlers will be full of euros from the public treasury.""

wavegaze,"I would have thought the whole Joost drama would teach people not to take everything at face value, but I guess that’s asking too much.

As a native Croatian speaker, I’ll try to highlight the main points from the interview while also explaining some of the nuances lost in translation.

* One of the first things they discuss is the preparties, emphasizing how exhausting they were, mainly due to the overwhelming number of interviews he had to give. He also mentions that he and Nemo were the two most sought-after artists for interviews. His biggest frustration was being repeatedly asked the same few questions (about the meaning behind his name, song, etc.). He also points out one particular question that infuriated him: 'How are you going to feel if you share the same fate as Let 3 and get snubbed by the juries?' 
* He shared his opinion on the Israeli televote results, attributing the strong support to effective marketing and national pride. He believes that the crowd booing Eden only boosted her support and votes. The interviewer suggests that the jury snubbing Israel indicates some kind of behind-the-scenes deal, given that it was a good song. However, Marko doesn't comment on this, simply stating that he completely understands why the juries ranked a song like The Code ahead of his. Throughout the interview, Marko has nothing but praise for Nemo and The Code, especially highlighting his rapping and vocals. They also praise Slimane's vocals.
* Regarding Bambie, he's not a fan of the song, as he has mentioned in previous interviews. He does say he believes they achieved the result they did thanks to the great staging and he isn't critical of that. He simply states that the performance elevated the song, which is something most of us can agree on. He was also not critical of Bambie for shouting Nemo’s name during the winner announcement and mentions that the Serbian delegation did the same for him. What he does criticize, however, is Bambie's hypocrisy. He points out that while they claim Eurovision is a festival of peace and love, they were throwing tantrums and yelling at members of the Israeli delegation who tried to take a photo of them and Marina right before the flag parade. This is where he uses a Croatian saying, 'foaming at the mouth like a dog,' to convey that Bambie was furious. He also criticizes cliquey behavior, specifically pointing out Bambie and Nemo (which, I believe, is the only instance where he was somewhat critical of Nemo).  
* Regarding the Joost incident, he explains that he sent someone else to do a rehearsal for him, which led to the EBU taking offense and banning him from attending further rehearsals that day. Although Joost claimed he was sick, Marko believes he simply didn't feel like participating. Reading between the lines, it seems Marko thinks there's a certain element of star-like behavior in Joost. After that, Joost was approached by a photographer from the event organization and he knocked the camera out of her hands. Marko doesn’t know the exact details and seems to be uninterested as he generally avoids drama. However, both he and his PR manager point out that there are cameras everywhere at Eurovision, and being photographed is something you should get used to.
* Marko remains almost completely silent during the discussion between the interviewer and his PR manager about the hypocrisy of artists who threatened to boycott Eurovision but ultimately performed. They dismiss it as nothing more than a publicity stunt, also calling out the artists' hypocrisy for being willing to work with Moroccan Oil, an Israeli company. Marko only comments on artists (without naming anyone except to say that Nemo wasn’t like this and was always true to himself) that will completely ignore you until they need content for social media, only to ignore you again once they’re done, calling this behavior creepy. Also mentions M&M's golden retriever energy and says Isaak was a nice guy. 
* He mentions that Eurovision was a very stressful experience and he felt a sense of relief when Nemo was announced as the winner, since now everything was finally over. He’s not upset about not winning and has no plans to compete again. In fact, he hopes to somewhat distance himself from everything as he doesn’t want to be remembered solely as a Eurovision artist. He is grateful for the experience but feels that now is the time for a new chapter.

The rest of the interview mainly focuses on his upcoming album release and future plans. He also touches on topics he discussed in earlier interviews, like knowing that sharing his religious background could hurt him in the long run, not following the betting odds and trying to live in the moment while enjoying the experience as much as he can.",li2sgjn,1723645085.0,2024-08-15T00:18:05,t3_1erxoxi,t3_1erxoxi,[],0

Smartie-chan,"It's days like these were Im more grateful than usual that I speak the language and can see for myself why everyone is loosing their mind. 

Im not gonna translate the whole interview but in case anyone cares, it's actually the interviewer who starts the whole Bambie thing. It's the very first sentence actually.
He says something along the lines of 

""After The Half-Final you were the main talking point in all of Croatia of course. *laughs* And the other was the  Irish woman."" (Please be aware we dont really have gender neutral forms in croatian so they misgender a lot during it. That being said, I did get the feel that the interviewer was not Bambie's biggest Fan, to say the least)

Later on its also AGAIN the interviewer who pushes into a certain direction. The PR Guy and the interviewer are talking about how they don't Like the song and how it's ""criminally bad"" (interviewer) and how they ""didnt like the pentagram stuff and all that"" (PR guy) then Marko is coming in with 2 sentences before the interviewer continues to talk about how the song (and Bambies vocals) are just not it , quote ""I dont know what that was *laughs*"" And then Markos changes the topic by recalling that incident where Bambie got angry cause they got filmed by the Israeli folks because he thought the way Bambie handled it was not cool. 

Marko simply said he didnt like Bambies song, that he enjoys others of the genre, thinks the song style is cool actually, but just wasnt vibing with theirs and that's - you know- totally okay. I dont see wtf people’s problem with those two statements was and is cause he's not  being mean about it???? Like, I dont like every single entry either. I dont see why he would NEED to LOVE every single song just because he's a public figure. 

Also, because I feel like the headline is kind of mean, I'd like you to know that ""angry dog"" is an idiom. He did not call her a dog. I guess if you were to translate it literally, then yes, but that’s like translating ""it's raining cats and dogs "" as ACTUAL cats and dogs falling from the sky. I think I would have translated it as ""as angry as a chili pepper"".",li2n7at,1723643285.0,2024-08-14T23:48:05,t3_1erxoxi,t3_1erxoxi,[],0

Jaynat_SF,"I'll try to extract the main points:

About Bambie's performance:

>I think they succeeded in the competition because the performance was excellently produced. I listen to songs in this style and have no problem with it, but their song – it just isn’t it.

About Bambie's backstage fight with at the Israeli delegation:

>Everyone was really shocked. I bit my lips trying not to laugh. She talks about a celebration of love and peace while shouting and getting angry, just unnecessary drama.

>\[Later at the interview\]

>The Israeli delegation was not a nuisance at all, at least from what I saw. And regarding Bambie’s claim that they film her, there are cameras everywhere and everyone is taking pictures of everyone.

What he knew about Joost's case prior to the finals (there is no mention about his personal stance on the matter):

>Joost didn’t even show up for the rehearsal... He was there but sent his ‘doppelgaenger’ to sing, so the EBU prevented him from attending the rehearsal. On that day, a camerawoman from the production approached to photograph him, and after he told her he didn’t agree, she said she had to. In response, he knocked the camera out of her hand.

About the calls to boycott due to Israel's participation:

>(PR manager): if you wanted to withdraw from the competition, you would just withdraw and not create drama and draw attention. If you want attention so much, just go on stage.

>\[Later at the interview\]

>(Baby Lasagna): If you are complaining about Israel’s presence, why are you taking photos with an Israeli brand in the background?

>(PR manager): I posted a story where I did a hairstyle with MoroccanOil, and everyone attacked me, saying it would negatively affect Baby Lasagna’s votes in the competition. Everyone there, one by one, had a MoroccanOil hairstyle.

There was also a bit about Bambie's manager forbidding her from performing for pro-Palestinian protestors outside the venue, but was brought up only by the interviewer, might just be a rumor, and the article did not mention any comment from Baby Lasagna or his manager.",li1z6lk,1723633292.0,2024-08-14T21:01:32,t3_1erxoxi,t1_li1vxka,[],0

GianMach,"Fair enough, but we've never seen it happen before during the shows week. I honestly thought it wasn't possible. With the current knowledge I don't see how Israel wasn't DQ'd in 2022 after Michael Ben David kissed Sheldon Riley on the lips against his will right on camera during the carpet event. 

But even disregarding that, the EBU disqualified an act unjustly and then even dig themselves further in their standpoint and change the goalposts when it is proven that their choice was wrong. They said at the time that they couldn't let Joost back into the venue as there was a police investigation ongoing regarding something that happened in the arena (which I can get, but there were other options than DQ upfront, like competing with the SF performance and keep the decision for full DQ or not for later) and now they say that the police investigation never mattered and they still stand by their decision.

At the same time, another delegation did worse things, made so many other delegation's time a nightmare, and even broke the commentary rules during the broadcast. So much proof that they broke the rules and yet nothing happened as a result.

Being put in such an unjust situation can happen to any other country next year. The only changes announced so far are mainly cosmetic and hot air and given the statements on the Joost situation it seems they learned nothing so far.

Black_Handkerchief,"I think Junior Eurovision ('24) would have never been considered as a boycot for the Netherlands in regards to the drama of this year for a few simple reasons.

1. These are kids competing and training hard because the show is in November, which means they are practicing hard already right now. AVROTROS opened their applications for JESC '24 participation in September of '23, so they will have been at it for quite some time! You can't just take all that effort and hope away from them. Responsible adults don't punish the hard-working kids for the drama of the adults.

2. These kids have a Eurovision dream much like Joost did. It would be utterly against the spirit of Joost's participation to destroy their dream at the finish line to support Joost who already lost his.

3. ESC and JESC are two different beasts with different people organizing them. The only shared thing is the EBU at the very top of the totem pole, but as we all know, they are never the ones actually producing the show itself. As such, the protest is more symbolic and out of solidarity than actually practically sensible.

As such, I feel participation in JESC '24 cannot be taken as any kind of confirmation that the Netherlands intends to participate in ESC '25. I think JESC '25 might end up on the boycot list if shit doesn't go well in the talks because the time to boycot that is actually perfect right now: no application call has gone out yet and I imagine it won't go out until AVROTROS knows for sure what kind of response the EBUs turtling warrants.",lhufzmz,1723513906.0,2024-08-13T11:51:46,t3_1eqre0a,t1_lhtmk9n,[],0

>Geneva’s Palexpo would host the contest, with a max capacity of 15,000 fans

I guess if they're planning to use Geneva Arena it will just become a Tel Aviv situation where the stage and most of the spectators are in the arena and the green room will be located in some other space at Palexpo. 

Edit: wow Geneva Arena seating configuration is actually pretty cool, which would make for some great camera shots [https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=662352152349937&set=a.662352139016605](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=662352152349937&set=a.662352139016605)",lfu4sva,1722444060.0,2024-08-01T02:41:00,t3_1efoms5,t1_lftv2p3,"['lg0emv3', 'lg0fqmo', 'lg1bk01', 'lg1k4mc', 'lg6xpl7']",5

The other rooms are going to be used for press and backstage. I also think they will use one of the rooms for the green room (the arena looks small like Tel Aviv) just like Malmo never had the green room inside the arena (this year it was behind the stage, not in the centre like previous years)

DaraVelour,"I don't think Netherlands will come in 2025 since the legal proceedings in Sweden are going very slowly (it might not even be resolved until the end of the year) and EBU ""changes"" are just a facade, EBU doesn't proper answers to fan media, they ghosted Slovenia's concerns about 2024 contest. They don't have Head of Delegation as of now and I doubt that they could find anybody to deal with EBU, especially after members of delegation including former HoD,  Twan van de Nieuwenhuijzen that was also working for EBU as Head of Contest in 2021-2023, expressed their harsh opinions about working with EBU. Cornald Mass, another member of delegation basically said ""fuck EBU"". And they know way more about what goes behind the closed doors than we ever will. The final decision will be published in September. Netherlands are the biggest financial contributor after big 5. The stakes are quite big and EBU will probably try to lure Netherlands to not withdraw, maybe offer becoming big 6 (just my speculation). If Netherlands withdraws, this might cause even more struggle for small countries to compete and the contest will be a Switzerland, already an expensive country. Also Netherlands up until Joost controversial disqualification were a country that stayed out of the big drama, at least for last decade or two. No cheating scandals, no major scandal with artists, no controversial songs. Netherlands are also one of the founders of Eurovision. Their possible withdrawal may have a big impact on the contest future because if they withdraw, what is keeping smaller, less successful countries? What is keeping countries like Czechia, where Eurovision is really unpopular and barely anyone watches it (and Czechia has 10 mln citizens, so it's still quite a lot for Europe)?

Greece: Sending one of the most popular singers here worked fairly well. Will ERT find out why it worked and what can work better? Because every rumour I've seen so far is questionable whether they can even qualify to the final.

Ukraine: This may be controversial. I fully support Ukraine in the war and Eurovision-wise they send great songs, but I feel some people may start becoming angry against them, especially after all this tension about what is considered political and what isn't. Many argued about the messages in Ukraine's staging this year being political (I mean Jerry Heil herself revealed them), plus the ""Free Azovstal Defenders"", plus people argue their televote score is sympathy points. So I'm curious to see how Ukraine will be next year and how they will handle the participation.

Spain: Ok this one is silly and not really serious, but there is a bit of a ""connection"" between the Euro tournament (football) and Eurovision. Greece won the Euro in 2004 (keep in mind that Greece winning the Euro was a huge surprise) and next year we won Eurovision. Portugal won the Euro in 2016 and then Eurovision in 2017.

Grouchy_Hamster3395,"Here's my experience as a 40 y.o. solo female traveler.

I went alone to Liverpool. i have traveled alone before, but not for something like a concert or festival. I have always either gone with someone or met up with a group there. As a female I always do my research on safety and keep an eye out while there.

Biggest problem thought is that I'm very introverted. Traveling and sightseeing alone is no bother. But even my introverted self wanted to have a (small lol) group around me to enjoy Eurovision. And I did, most of the time. For the live viewing of Semi 1 at the Eurovillage i saw a group of people i know from a forum of which i have been a member for at least a decade. It took me about half an hour to rehearse the introduction lol. but i got over my shyness and the group was very open and friendly, We had a blast, even though Sudden Lights didn't make it through.

For the Semi 2 rehearsal at the arena since i had SRO tickets i had to be there hours in advance. Talking in the line while waiting kinda happened naturally and i got ""adopted"" by this lovely gay couple. We spent that rehearsal cheering and dancing together right by the stage. Fun fun fun!

Semi 2 live for multiple reason was a dud for me, but still ok.

During the grand finale at a rooftop bar i was accepted by a large and loud group of Spanish fans as one of their own lol so i had grand time too.

So unless you are EXTREMELY OFF THE CHARTS introverted, you will meet people there, if only for that one evening to experience the show together. Who knows, you might find new friends, or maybe more lol",ldcz1pt,1721081255.0,2024-07-16T08:07:35,t3_1e470ae,t3_1e470ae,[],0

I'm not entirely sure about age restrictions on the Eurovision shows/tickets. I know they have a ""family show"", it's the dress rehearsal that happens in the afternoon, just right before the televised shows, and it's there precisely to allow people to go with their children, so they allow under 18s there, for sure.

But I think you should be okay with the night shows too. Just keep an eye on when tickets come out and make sure to read all the rules surrounding them.

As for the experience of going alone, you should be fine, you'll be surrounded by people with a common interest and honestly, I feel like you being American will be a great conversation starter, since there aren't usually many at attendance.",ldwg3ux,1721378220.0,2024-07-19T18:37:00,t3_1e470ae,t1_ldudns2,[],0

DaraVelour,"In years 2001-2008 we got a new winning country. Most from Eastern Europe and Balkans (adjacent). Since 2012 the only Eastern European country that won was Ukraine. Azerbaijan was a fluke, possible vote rigging and a song written by Swedes, so not even authentic. Re-introduction of juries lowered the chances of the rest non-winning countries to win by a lot. The only new winner in last decade was Portugal. The possibility of getting first time winner is low, really low, especially with how things went in recent years, when two years in a row nobody is able to catch up to jury winner and juries are biased a lot towards mainstream western European (sounding) music. Portugal was the only non mainstream sounding song that won jury in last decade. Even The Code is moderately mainstream sounding. At least more than Portugal 2017. And it's in English.

Lithuania feels more likely than Armenia, and I'd love to see them join Estonia and Latvia. It doesn't feel right that they got their wins back to back but Lithuania's still waiting 20+ years later.

But as much as I'd love to see Lithuania win, I'd want to see Armenia win first. They and Georgia have had plenty of winners in JESC (5 between them), it's about time they win the adult contest. Plus Armenia's recent results has them on track for a new best result anyway, so they may as well go for the gold.",ldaiq42,1721052278.0,2024-07-16T00:04:38,t3_1e2fnwj,t1_ld1fodu,[],0

Yeah, and we never had a straight right majority government since Mussolini, and Esc has never been so relevant in Italy as recent days, so that does mean nothing and right wings are showing to be desparate about someone representing them in pop culture that as of now has been a left artists thing, and now they've have just lost Morgan, burnt by the stalking situation.

All the major roles substituted by total yes men.

High profile news  conductors suspended only because they dared critize rai's decisions.

High profile show hosts who are all literally running away (even Insinna went to Channel 9, i mean...Insinna...the puppy of Mamma Rai... if even him decided to run away it means the situation is baaaaad)

I paid around 80-90€ for my seat which had a great view, but depending on the seat/zone it can get more expensive or cheaper.

I believe for other NFs the ticket sales date will be announced through ESC websites, so the key really is to be subscribed to them and stay up to date. Usually this info is out during ESC off-season, so that's why some people might miss it.

That would have happened probably any year it's just coincidence that it happened at the same time as the Israel stuff. I mean the chances of them being disqualified 2 years in a row is basically 0.

However, to overcome the problem, another color could be use, a color associated with the country (e.g. Savoy Azure for Italia).

The same happens on the scoreboard. But maybe a 'border' could be used around the flags to make them stand out, or a different shape.

JaDasIstMeinName,"This shares a big issue with a lot of other ideas for visual designs:  
It just looks too simular. The blue-white-red ones are ok, but the countries with just red-white are literally the same. It would be fine with 2 maybe 3 countries looking the same, but austria, georgia, latvia, malta, poland, denmark and switzerland all share the same colorpalet.

  
I do understand why you went for a red background, since its switzerland and i am assuming you realized it already since you used a rather dark tone, but the voting templates hurt my eyes, because all the red practically screams at you.

My first two thoughts seeing this was “this is actually really cool” and “the white in Poland and Denmarks flag coloured graphics makes it look really weird”

Overall really cohesive and great looking theme. The white in the flag coloured graphics were the only thing that stood out.


I think the gradient idea is good. But I would put the colour in the gradient for the white, way closer to white. Having the white gradient overall a lot brighter.

Fun fact: The only time a preselection was held for Andorra's participation was in 2004, their first ever entry, and it wasn't even held by RTVA!

Instead, Catalonia's public broadcaster (TV3, which is way bigger in general but also bigger in Andorra than RTVA 😵‍💫) hosted a 9-show preselection called ""12 Punts"", recorded from Ba~~rcelona A~~ndorra's National Auditorium, with the condition that the chosen entry had to become the first ever song sung in Catalan language to participate. The official broadcaster for Eurovision was still RTVA, though.

I wonder if this kind of collaboration could happen nowadays in order to help bring Andorra back.

alleurovision,"A tad too 'fleshy pink' for me (especially against the Swiss red). But, the concept and the bones are there. Well done. The scoreboard is def my fav. Your album cover layout is good too, very '23. 

I think being inspired by graphic elements from the Grammys (I would say 2021/22's edition onwards), would add depth and 'elegance' to your design. I'm specifically talking about the metallic flower design (I forget the year). It's geometric and mountain-like - I think good inspo could come from that, and the Grammy graphics are 'presentational', so inspo for title/name cards etc. Otherwise these are good bones to reshape.

While to mention my country, while they did mention a possible return, on local sites they said there is no future for us since there is no planing and no enjoyment from RTCG to even compete, and after this year which we DIDN'T EVEN SHOW THE CONTEST BUT TALKED A LOT ABOUT IT AFTER, and all the deliciously mean comments about this year from my people and the contestants, especially Ireland and Netherlands, i don't see a future for us.

BenedWa21,">Dear Mr. Osterdahl,

>As Director General of Radio Television of Kosovo (RTK) I am writing to you on behalf of RTK to ask for an invitation to participate in the upcoming Eurovision Song Contest, organized by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Participation in this high-level cultural event in Europe is our strong ambition and of great importance for our European Union integration. 

>RTK has been actively fostering musical talent and promoting cultural exchange within Kosovo. We have successfully organized our own national song contest, which has garnered significant popularity among Kosovans. This year, we will proudly host the second edition of our contest, with the hope that the winning song will represent Kosovo in the next year's Eurovision Song Contest. 

>Although Kosovo currently has a special Agreement and a status with the EBU, we are inspired by the example of countries like Australia, which have been invited to participate in Eurovision. We firmly believe that the Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political event that celebrates music, diversity, and unity, values that resonate deeply with our nation. 

>We respectfully request your consideration in extending an invitation to RTK to participate in the next Eurovision Song Contest. Our participation would not only showcase the vibrant talent of Kosovo but also reinforce the spirit of inclusion and cultural exchange that Eurovision embodies. 

>Last but not least, the EBU has played a crucial role in establishing RTK back in 1999, thus we hope that you will look into helping us to achieve this goal, enshrined in our mission as public broadcaster. Thank you for considering our request. We look forward to the possibility of contributing to and enriching this prestigious event.

>Warm regards, 

>Shkumbin Ahmetxhekaj

AmrakCL,"Celebrate is probably one of the most hated winners because many felt it was undeserved and the votes were manipulated, in essence, that the competition was bought. Seeing as the second place went to Jacques Houdek which is arguably one of the best vocalists in Croatia and his song ""Stotinama Godina"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zADvgUe\_e94) has become a classic, it's easy to see why. Also, after 2011. Dora was completely discontinued until 2019. and we entered into complete irrelevancy. Ironically, Jacques was the only bright spot until Let 3, and he basically had to finance everything himself. 

I'm not a fan of ""Moja Štikla"", it's complete nonsense with what, if we're generous, can be described as etno elements, but it's mostly just annoying. However, if you don't speak the language, it's probably more enjoyable since you don't have process the sheer nonsense coming out of her mouth :D

Lejla was great, one of the greatest ex-Yu entries to ESC. Personally, I thinks it's better than both Joskimović entries, and Molitva as well. Marija Magdalena is a classic. She was close to the top, but we're still kind of sore because we think it deserved the win, and feel a bit robbed XD If we do get an even bigger party next year, who knows, maybe Doris will come and sing.

Judging by the comments, people seem to be in their own bubble here. Maybe in the Netherlands, because of the disqualification of their contestant, Eurovision really has a bad reputation. But in other countries it is not so. If some participants talked about ""tension behind the scenes"", others did not talk about it at all. I think ""tension"" existed only for some participants, but not for all.



For most not-so-rich countries and their participants, Eurovision is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to gain popularity for a young artist.

I assure you that the refusal of one or two countries will in no way affect the overall competition. The competition for the rest will simply decrease.

Basel is very well connected to the continent by rail and road and features the third largest airport of the country (operated together with France). 

The most likely venue would be the St. Jakobhalle, which seats 12'400, but they are also checking if it's possible to host the event at the St. Jakob-Park, the football stadium, which would seat over 35'000. This would also make it by far the largest venue in the running.

TheGoBetweens,"I will say this: I'm not entirely upset about the artists they've selected for the national final recently. There has been variety, there has been quality. You can tell the team has been putting effort into it, with limited ressources and willing artists, at least from 2023 onwards. And the national final does showcase successfully which performance works well on television... it's just that so far, those never end up representing Germany at Eurovision.

The key challenge for NDR is to make people understand what a successful Eurovision performance needs holistically, beyond a performer who's perceived as down-to-earth. Unfortunately, German television (mostly) isn't on par in terms of production value, especially when there's music involved, so viewers at home don't really understand the criteria for televised excellence. You can tell that a country such as Ukraine has the culture, drive and mindset for it, even in wartime.

Treewithatea,"Ill give you my perspective. We Germans know how to produce music, we have one of the largest music industries in the entire world. 4th or 5th largest I believe. So what is the issue then? The clear issue is the people responsible for the ESC selection. The public tv/radio channels arent exactly known for taking risks, the last thing these people want is to lose their job for a slightly too offensive thing. Youll rarely find edgy entertainers in those channels and if you do, they are creatively compromised. 

My issue is that our ESC entrants dont even represent what we like to listen ourselves. What do Germans listen to? German rap has become incredibly popular, Apache 207 is probably the biggest German artist right now, you also have some female rappers who got very popular recently and you actually hear those frequently in the radio. Then you have German rock/metal, Rammstein is the obvious one that also heavily influences the entire european music scene. This years croatian performance and last years finnish performance had huge Rammstein influence, both artists big rammstein fans. Yes we had metal last year but it wasnt good if im being honest but I dont see a reason to give up on rock/metal entirely, especially with rock/metal Songs winning the public vote twice in a row now. 

Then you have a third category of popular german artists which is EDM and German artists are very successful and popular in this genre. Robin Schulz, Felix Jaehn, Zedd, DJ Topic and many more. Artists not only successful in Germany but worldwide. 

When you look at the qualifiers you rarely find even songs that Germans in 2024 would even listen to, you barely find artists and songs that fit in any of those three categories, music that Germans themselves like to listen to 

And on top of that, we dont even send German language songs. Ive looked it up, we havent sent a German language song since 2007. You might think the people behind the selection dont even like the German language when unsurprisingly, Germans enjoy listening to German language music. So what are we sending? Generic english pop and generic pop is the least offensive thing one can possibly send and generic pop will never stand out because pop as a genre is sooooo huuuuge, youre competing with the likes of Taylor Swift, Harry Styles and so on, gigantic world stars. It would be so much easier to have a more unique song. Just using your native language is an easy way to be unique but I may be a bit biased because I generally prefer esc artists singing in their native language over english. 

The electric callboy drama is a perfect representation of everything wrong about the selection process. Those guys wouldve rocked ESC and them being rejected for not being 'radio friendly' is so ironic because ive never heard any of the german esc songs in GERMAN RADIO ITSELF besides that one song called rockstars. Electric callboy was simply too offensive for them, couldnt handle the vocals and showing off too much skin from women probably, have no idea really.

I don't know how it is in other countries, but my OGAE (not Swiss) only offers fan ticket packages for members of over a year, which would be too late for you. Again, I don't know how it is in other countries but here you always have to buy a ticket package for all 5 evening shows, they are very expensive! I don't know what the rules are for reselling the ones you don't want, but I know other members have split them between them.

PoetryAnnual74,I got maybe a total of 10 tickets to the grand final for me and friends etc by just checking Ticketmaster the weeks before. A few days before the grand final tickets could actually be up for several days before getting booked. So it was crazy enough really easy to get tickets the days before. I’m planning on maybe going to Switzerland even if I do not have tickets for final next year and try to grab them the days before. If I don’t get tickets then then I bet watching in Eurovision village is also nice and Switzerland I mean is always a lovely country to visit no matter what 😀,l76p1z8,1717571687.0,2024-06-05T17:14:47,t3_1d8ir9d,t3_1d8ir9d,"['l76puxr', 'l77lonr']",2

Then about a week before the shows we saw heaps available on Ticketmaster! Luckily we were staying
In Malmo for about 3 nights so we ended up getting resale VIP1 tickets for semi final 2 for about a quarter of their original sale price.

So try for the global sale and keep an eye on dates but if you miss out on the first global sale don’t be discouraged as people will be reselling/cancelling tickets. Plan to stay in the host city for a few nights to keep your options open.

RollingSnowballs,"We (me and my sister) went for the first time this year. Each of us used 4 devices to queue in ticketmaster.se. Only my phone got 40k position, others were 100k. Anyway, the live final was sold out by the time it got to my turn, so I bought 2 final jury show tickets (Lower A, front row, really nice seats). We planned to stay there and watch the live final outside/in the bar with other fans, so we booked the hotel until Saturday night. 

Fast forward to this year Semi 1 live show. It was so good, so fun that we started wondering what it would be like if we were in the final. Then, Wednesday morning, one day before we got on to the ferry to Copenhagen, my sister woke me up to buy the resaled tickets for the final live show. They were also lower A, but backstage. It took us 10 minutes to make the decision and check out. There were plenty of resaled tickets at that time, most of them were standing tickets, or backstage seats.

And the experience was so fun (except all the drama and protest in Malmö). We enjoyed Semi 2 on TV in the ferry cabin, went to the jury show with the best view, checked out how things happened backstage during the final live show (the seats were not bad at all, we could see everything), and even appeared on TV.

So, to successfully buy a ticket, I think you should use multiple devices to queue to increase the chance to get to the front of the queue. And keep checking the ticketmaster page for resales.",l7euyv5,1717699330.0,2024-06-07T04:42:10,t3_1d8ir9d,t3_1d8ir9d,['l7g25ho'],1

And if course its not guaranteed to get. Fanclubs get more tickets the bigger they are but also the bigger they are, competition is steeper too. 
And probably the most important is that they are only packages for all shows. They can cost well over 700€ and it's not possible to resell part of it. 

As for buying tickets through general sale i guess it goes without saying that you have better chance to get a job at your tv station or become friends with artist and get taken as a member of delegation than to get tickets through ticketmaster.

odajoana,"> We're still in the ""live final or nothing"" mindset though.

This is all going to be my opinion, but I find this a little bit silly. Apart from the results, the dress rehearsals are the exact same shows as the televised, especially the jury shows. 

In fact, they're even more fun, as you get to see fun rehearsal stuff and overall see a show no one else does. In case of the final, you even get to see the performances the jury evaluates. Not only that, more fans than casuals attend those, the vibe is usually a lot better and more invested in the acts.

Also, don't forget Eurovision is a made-for-TV show. It's a lot of fun to watch live, but for the full experience, the TV shows, with all the camerawork are still a better way to enjoy the show. Any bits with the hosts, any VTs that roll and even the detailed results are usually completely lost on the live audience. Which again, makes for a better experience to go to the jury shows live and then watch the ""real thing"" on TV on the next day.

I might be biased because in semifinal 2, I was way closer to the stage and sitting next to a close friend, so I got to share the hype with her.

Nerioner,"Sadly there is no way to buy fan tickets that don't include all shows. They are at a small discount though at least they were cheaper than individual seats in Rotterdam. Not much but a few euros. And you get other perks like euro cafe access often with those. 

But to get it in a hosting year can be tough. What happened in the Netherlands when we won was that suddenly thousands of folks signed up for fanclub to have a kick at tickets. Multiplying number of members by several folds. Therefore they limited access to tickets. First priority was for members that were there for over a year and then what's left was for new ones. 


And last unrelated point. 
Fan tickets are more expensive option to experience Eurovision Live but if you live in the city hosting or close you save a lot on hotels and travel. So even if you spend more on tickets, general household budget is not hurting more than when traveling for single show somewhere",l76qywm,1717573082.0,2024-06-05T17:38:02,t3_1d8ir9d,t1_l76q42i,"['l76rgy2', 'l76rt44']",2

A lot of the past entries have been artists who’ve done TV, but very little if any *actual* tours or live venue shows. It’s no knock on them as musicians; they’re all phenomenal, but it’s not the same universe that Voyager has existed in for its life. In fact, this is the one distinction I noticed more than anything: the TV world has practically zero crossover with the music world in Australia.

We knew the kind of opportunity ESC gave us to promote ourselves, and did *everything* we could to capitalise. It’s really up to every individual artist/band to take what they can from the comp. And to quell any thoughts on this: SBS gave us the same level of treatment as all previous artists, financially and otherwise. We had to work extremely hard to apply for grants/funding, everything.

Montaigne was hampered by the 2020 song being better IMO, but mainly by being unable to travel there live. So the 2021 song felt more like a low budget music video than a performance in front of an arena, which hurt it greatly in votes. ""Don't Break Me"" on a live stage likely does better.

This year, they only just missed out despite the low budget and promotion, and of all things I think the biggest factor of it was the bad luck of getting put in the semi which had all three of Croatia - Slovenia - Serbia in it, giving each country a 20 to 24 point swing of points. Of course, Croatia didn't need the help, but Slovenia and Serbia were 9th and 10th so it likely saved both of them.

basetornado,"Money. We had some entrys backed by record labels with big names, and they did pretty well. Then those deals stopped, and SBS had to go to a national competition, but because we don't have the history of other national competitions, no one actually watched it for it to be worthwhile some of our larger artists to take part. The winners we got from it Kate Miller Heidke, Montaigne and Sheldon Riley. Kate Miller Heidke could have competed easily without the competition if she had wanted. She's popular here and hence why she won. Montaigne is also pretty big, but their only real competition was a washed up ex Australian Idol winner who only won because another record label rigged the vote so they could sign second place, and a singer who was big in the early 2000s.  

Then 2022, there was no one watching it anymore and no big names entered. Sheldon Riley beat Voyager on jury votes, because the competition was so lax at that point.

To make a point about viewing figures, 200,000 people watched it. On the same night 600,000 watched a rerun of Antiques Roadshow.

2023 the money though came back with Voyager having a deal with the Western Australia State government for tourism purposes and they did great, despite having a poor overall score. 

This year though SBS didn't have any sponsor deals and so they went with Electric Fields who had tried to qualify in 2019 because they were cheap. It predictably didn't work out.",l6wd9lx,1717415974.0,2024-06-03T21:59:34,t3_1d715nq,t3_1d715nq,"['l6wp7uq', 'l6wgdnf', 'l6whohj']",3

Squaret22,"I just checked this Delta and she is definitely massive in Australia. Usually ESC can be used for two things. First is if you’re a less known artist or have your career going down you can use it to get a boost in your home country. If you’re already doing well you can use it as a way of crossing over to international markets. If all goes well you can actually get the internal and external boost.

Delta wouldn’t really get any internal boost from this unless she got a victory, I’d say. On the other hand, a bad placement could really hurt her. So it would be a big time commitment from hers, getting the perfect song and then a great performance to actually do really well and have a chance of making it internationally. Is it worth all that effort? 

Also one extra thing, I don’t really think the performance in the opening of the commonwealth games is in any way comparable to ESC. As in, ESC is the bigger more impacting stage. Whoever was saying commonwealth has 1,5 Billion and then ESC has 160 million? No, viewership of the opening of commonwealth is way smaller. A quick googling shows that, for example India pulled 11 million viewers which is like what Germany + Sweden pull for Eurovision.

LandslideBaby,"This is unrealistic, I'm sorry.

Can't imagine that the optics of ""our country is too expensive, here's a campground"" would go well with the Swiss. People who camp and festival goers tend to be seen as cheap and unless you ban food and drink from entering the campgrounds, I think it's more likely that people will just eat and drink there.

With the rates airlines cost carrying all the camping equipment (tent+mattress+sleeping bag) seems expensive for a subpar experience. Plus you would also need extra warm clothing due to the following point:

There is also as mentioned, the weather. The problem isn't only the potential of rain, but also temperatures. It gets cold at night in a tent. You really can't shake the mud of you if it rains and the campgrounds get muddy. You would need to have hot showers for a minimum of comfort (if you want encourage people who are going to be in an enclosed space to not skip on showers or to go shower at the accomodation they have a friend in)  and installing all that is expensive.",l6ilf02,1717181546.0,2024-06-01T04:52:26,t3_1d4yqyv,t3_1d4yqyv,[],0

Realistically, it's just going to be an expensive one. I have an easy time saying that given that I live here, but purely based on cost of food/drinks, my experience in Norway and Denmark was that prices seemed reasonably similar and we've survived that too.

**Preparation for the Eurovision Song Contest 2025 in Switzerland**

Switzerland is gearing up to host the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) 2025 after Nemo won the 68th edition in Malmö with their song ""The Code."" Following their victory, SRG (Swiss Broadcasting Corporation) immediately began planning. A twelve-member task force, consisting of experts from all SRG units and language regions, has already started preparations. The task force is proposing candidates for the project leadership, with a final decision expected soon.

**Requirements for the Host City**

Cities interested in hosting the ESC have until the end of June to submit their dossiers. These dossiers include comprehensive requirement catalogs, adapted by the SRG task force based on documents from the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Key criteria include a suitable event hall, airport access, and financing. Additionally, cities must present their own vision for the ESC, including a supporting program.

**Selection Process and Schedule**

The host city must also offer a comprehensive supporting program, similar to the Eurovision Village concert in Folkets Park in Malmö. Estermann emphasized that hosting such an event within a year is a significant challenge and time is pressing.

In the current week, interested cities were sent the so-called Host City Bid Books – extensive catalogs of requirements for the applications. These not only include a suitable event hall, airport access, and financing but also require cities to present their own vision for the ESC, including a supporting program.

Using existing documents from the EBU and previous host countries, the SRG task force has ""Swiss-ified"" the requirements. The SRG has not disclosed the number of cities currently in the running. Some cities have expressed interest on their own, while others have been approached by the SRG. Estermann highlighted that smaller cities are not at a disadvantage compared to larger ones, and the language region will not be a deciding factor. ""There are no favorites.""

A goal has already been set: ""We aim to decide by the end of August where the ESC will be held in mid-May 2025,"" says Estermann. This would keep the Swiss project on schedule, as in previous years, the decision has sometimes been communicated as late as October. Cities, along with the respective hall operators and cantons, now have until the end of June to prepare their dossiers. The exact dates in May for the shows have yet to be determined.

**Finances and Logistics**

The ESC is a major logistical challenge, requiring 26 cameras, 56 microphones, 68 speakers, 110 WiFi transmitters, and a total of 200 tons of technology in the Malmö Arena alone.

Parallel to the selection process, the structure for the Swiss ESC project is being developed. Personnel are needed for production, technology, security, finance, communication, marketing, sponsorship, and legal issues. Overall, hundreds of people will be involved, says Estermann. Many will be recruited and reassigned internally from SRG, several specialists will be taken over from the EBU, and external forces will also be involved.

Estermann is confident that the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation can financially manage the large-scale event. ""The last Swiss ESC was 36 years ago. We've benefited from a great show all these years and were able to broadcast it. Now it's our turn to show solidarity."" Moreover, the ESC is an attractive project. ""We can already feel the excitement and enthusiasm,"" says Estermann.

**Funding**

Which city can contribute the most financially? Geneva has shown great interest in hosting the ESC and meets the key criteria with its airport, hotels, and the Palexpo complex.

In the current political climate, with initiatives to halve the budget of SRG, it is crucial that the Swiss ESC imposes as little financial burden as possible. The cost of the Swiss ESC will depend on where and how it is hosted. ""It depends on what kind of ESC the hosting city plans,"" says Estermann.

The SRG will have to contribute significantly, typically between 10 and 20 million Swiss francs. However, funds will also come from other sources, such as the EBU, which contributes a base of 6 million francs, and ticket sales.

Ultimately, cities that can contribute more to the financing through sponsorships or contributions from the city and canton will have an advantage in the selection process. This was the case two years ago with Liverpool. ""It has been seen that the ESC can be very lucrative for a region. The added value in Liverpool was significantly higher than the investments,"" says Estermann.",l6by8rl,1717080441.0,2024-05-31T00:47:21,t3_1d45kwe,t3_1d45kwe,[],0

None,"For many years now she is my biggest wish as well. But besides it becoming less and less probable with each year passing, although she never said that she would never compete, and her becoming older, she is still incredibly fit though, I think I came to the realisation that the ESC isn't as suited to her as I think. She ticks so many boxes which would imply that she does, but what I think makes her that great is her versatility. She does two and a half hours concerts with siniging without a single wrong note, dancing and even acrobatics etc.. She is so good at so many things, but not absolutely outstanding at anything. For example she definitely is a superior singer to Chanel, but I don't think that she can dance like her what made people vote for Chanel. She would have the complete package, but the rules of the ESC hinder her from showing her full potential. If she ever gets to compete it is incredibly unlikely that it will be in the next 2 years. She has a tour announced for 2026 already and is apparently working on an album with children's songs now. I doubt and hope not to be honest that at her 2026 tour her most recent album will be her latest from 2021, so she might be working on a regular album as well. Besides that many people think that she announced that tour only for 2026 is that she wants her 2nd child in the meantime. So 2027 would be the earliest likely year and then she will be almost 43. She wouldn't be past her prime like other very famous acts, but I fear we are past the point getting her on her absolute top.

_dreamer1,"I agree with you and I'd also like to see the UK try to change up its Eurovision strategy but the discussion after this year's GF got me thinking that the best route for the big 5 nowadays is to focus on the jury appeal. After this year's results there were (again) many posts discussing the jury/public power dynamics and what I found interesting was the idea that while the public is coming to the GF with already chosen favorites which they helped to qualify in the semis, the jury doesn't have those songs which it would've helped to save in the semis in the old voting system, and thus tends to pile votes on a few favorites. 

So, with this current state, I think the UK's best chance for a good result is to try to appeal to the jury first and, ideally, snatch some public votes along the way thanks to a memorable song and staging and, especially, a great and charismatic performer. As we've seen with France this year ""jury bait"" song can do that. 

I know that the main goal of Eurovision is to appeal to the audience, but if you focus on the *contest* element and try to come up with a solution for the UK to do better as you say in your post, I think this could be the way to do it.",l5ijhcq,1716578945.0,2024-05-25T05:29:05,t3_1czq00o,t3_1czq00o,[],0

But I definitely agree that it would be a nice change for UK, even if she didn't light up the scoreboard.

Ya know ... As I was watching the 137-or-so entries this year that were SSK (Standard Slo-mo Knockoff), it occurred to me that *UK would never consider entering something like that*. Not saying they should ... just struck me as peculiar. You KNOW it would never even cross their minds over there at the Beeb.

NeoLeonn3,"If the UK absolutely had to send pop, then I don't care who sings as long as they can sing live and they have Clarence Clarity as the producer (who has produced a large number of Rina Sawayama's songs and some of Dorian Electra's songs, but has some interesting music on his own as well). I understand people want Rina (I want her too), but I feel even having Clarence Clarity would be game-changing.

Now outside of pop (at least the radio-friendly basic one), if there's one person I can think who can sing, write songs that could feel unique in Eurovision and put a great show (I think she can dance too) and is English too, it's FKA twigs. Out of artists who are somewhat popular (not in the levels of Dua Lipa or Harry Styles for example, but still famous) and I am aware of their music, she's the only one I can think that could even deliver a win for the UK.

But honestly, the UK could learn something from Croatia this year. We all know how Baby Lasagna was one of the reserves in Dora but in the end he brought Croatia's best ever result and while he was an unknown artist he ended up being Croatia's favourite. If there's one country that I feel they definitely had multiple potentially Eurovision-winner songs submitted to them and they got rejected just to select songs that in the end ended up last, it's the UK.",l5jbi46,1716589761.0,2024-05-25T08:29:21,t3_1czq00o,t3_1czq00o,[],0

I’ve always thought some catchy pop-oriented rock with a distinct sound like The LaFontaines would do well. Most of the good artists who would succeed don’t want to participate or don’t have an in with the BBC to do so. 

Live vocals and a unique song and presentation is all that matters and where the UK consistently fails at. The UK entries are consistently boring and forgettable in addition to bad vocals and staging.",l5ipret,1716581279.0,2024-05-25T06:07:59,t3_1czq00o,t3_1czq00o,[],0

thebeatsandreptaur,"Never heard of Cassyette until this thread and listened to some of her music as a result. Irelands entry was my favorite by far, and I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't be looking for evidence of a bit of copycatting if she was in Eurovision 2025, but from what I've seen she's different enough from Ireland's entry so I wouldn't worry too much.

I also think since she has dealt with Eurovision drama already, she might just have the knowledge of its innerworkings to meet any of that drama head on and would be able to make something uniquely her own, especially because of that extra need to really stand out as her own as an artist. I think her prior work would make her more likely to avoid anything in her power to avoid being accused of being a copycat.

In my catching up of Eurovision fun one thing that always stood out to me was how UK has never really sent anyone more alternative, which is crazy to me since goth and punk are so rooted in the history of the UK. It's crazy to me and stood out to me instantly as a newcomer when watching compilation videos of years past, and I think it'd be crazy to push it off much longer.

I'm not saying it HAS to be Cassyette but I don't see how it'd somehow be perceived as ""worse"" or more ""copycatty"" for her to do it vs any other alternative act just because she worked behind the scenes on another one. It seems to me that it'd be the same sort of folks that would put that much stock into her doing it would be same types of people that would a reason to say it regardless.

The music industry is bigger than Eurovision. Eurovision artists use Eurovision to get ahead in the music industry. The buyers, aka customers, are people.

Kosovo has been a member of UEFA since 2016 if I'm not mistaken, therefore their football teams play in European tournaments and that includes their national team as well. Serbia is still a member of UEFA. Kosovo has definitely played against teams from countries that don't recognize it (they have played against Greece in 2022 for the UEFA Nations League and most likely they have played more games).

Football is taken sometimes way more seriously at the political side of things compared to Eurovision, especially when we are talking about the Balkans, so if there is no issue with Kosovo there, I don't see any issues sprouting suddenly at Eurovision.

DasSockenmonster,"I would love to see Kosovo taking part, but them entering would probably piss Serbia off as Serbia still thinks Kosovo belongs to them. Factoring in that some countries such as Slovakia, Spain (who also don't recognise Catalonia), Bosnia and Herzegovina and Romania don't recognise Kosovo as an independent country. If they do enter, it would mean that Serbia would have to begrudgingly deal with the fact or withdraw.  I can't see what the harm is in having them compete, it's just who would represent them? I mean, Rita Ora could, she's of Kosovan/Albanian descent. You could also have Era Istrefi as well. It hasn't stopped Wales trying, we made many attempts to take part in Eurovision and Cân i Gymru was intended to be our Eurovision selection show. The only reason why we didn't make it was due to issues with our broadcasters, meaning that we have two separate ones, S4C broadcasts exclusively in Welsh and they did take part in JESC because the BBC didn't want to until they decided that they wanted to come back.

> Will Kosovo make its debut at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2025? The public broadcaster Radio Televizioni i Kosovës (RTK) is determined to push ahead with this project and is aiming to take part in the ESC next year. This is according to a press release published during this year's ESC week.


> What is certain at the moment is that the “Festivali i Këngës në RTK”, the Kosovan counterpart to the Albanian “Festivali i Këngës”, which was launched last year, will be continued at the end of 2024. RTK's declared aim is to submit the winning entry from the competition as the Kosovan entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2025:


> “We are optimistic that the winning song of the second festival in a row will represent Kosovo in the international competition.”


> However, there are still a few hurdles to overcome before this can happen. So far, RTK is not a member of the EBU due to Kosovo's unclear status under international law - currently only 115 of the 193 member states of the United Nations recognize Kosovo as an independent state. One way to join the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and thus participate in the Eurovision Song Contest would be to become a member of the Council of Europe. Although an initiative to this effect has only just failed for the time being, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has already spoken out in favor of accession. A second possible route into the EBU is via membership of the International Telecommunication Union, a specialized agency of the United Nations.


> In the above-mentioned press release, RTK also claims to have the support of other countries for ESC participation:


> “The board and management of RTK have continuously worked on this issue and support has been gained from many countries, but on the other hand there are constant obstacles for political reasons from some countries that do not recognize Kosovo.”


> What exactly this support relates to - whether ESC participation, EBU membership or an overarching political issue - remains unclear for the time being. In any case, RTK appears to be optimistic about participating in the ESC in 2025.


> Kosovo's “Festivali i Këngës” took place for the first time last year. There were two qualifying rounds and a final between October 26 and 28, 2023. In the end, a five-member jury chose La Fazani as the winner with his song “Oj Kosovë”.


> RTK is delighted with the first edition:


> “The organization of the first festival was marked by many challenges and difficulties, but with the experience, commitment and leadership of the festival director and the dedicated staff of RTK, it became possible to realize this great cultural project, which received great support from the Ministry of Culture.


> The festival has given space to young artists to not only perform their songs at the festival, but also to show them on all RTK channels. Building on this goal, organization and experience, the second edition of 'Festivali i Këngës në RTK' promises to be even more spectacular and provide a platform for emerging artists to showcase their talent and creativity on a nationwide competition platform.”


> As outlined above, FiK will also serve as the Kosovan preselection for the Eurovision Song Contest in the future.",l51otk6,1716311561.0,2024-05-22T03:12:41,t3_1cx73bz,t1_l51i0ag,"['l51pje2', 'l9hdg26']",2

Not to mention that the inclusion of Kosovo would lead to Serbia probably withdrawing which would then require the EBU to make a political statement on the inclusion of Kosovo which is just unlikely to happen so I doubt that the inclusion of Kosovo is going to happen in 2025.,l53ey90,1716334081.0,2024-05-22T09:28:01,t3_1cx73bz,t1_l52or1n,[],0

As a Czech fan, the voting disadvantage bothers me the most and it feels that the broadcaster doesn't care if anyone here cares about our participation.

Also, it's much the same as it was under the previous government, except for all the embarrassments and Orban worship. Let's not forget that the previous right-wing PM was the only sitting PM in the world to congratulate Trump on his win in 2020, hours after the polls closed.

I don't think so since they're going with Szansa na sukces which is a terrible format and the only reason we got good candidates from it is because it's also format that's easy to rig towards/against a candidate.

Tomas-T,"- Romania, Bulgaria, and North Macedonia back (making it 40 countries)

- less dramatic and calmer year for everyone

- the big 5+host performing in the semis but as the interval act and not in-between

- bringing the juries to the semis

- in short brining back what was in 2022 

- keeping rest of the world

- the voting begin after all of the song

- less biased for one or two songs from the juries

- more rock

- less ""circus"" entries

- more countries break their NQ streak

- too hopeful thinking but I want every 2020 artists who did not returned to get his/her chance. which counts: The Mamas, Val, Little Big, Damir, Sandro, Ulrikke, Alicja, Ben & Tan, Arilena, Aksel, Athena, Eliza, Diodato, Ben, and Tom (as for Val and Little Big, they can return for San Marino LOL)",l3wx2ad,1715637161.0,2024-05-14T07:52:41,t3_1cra2t7,t3_1cra2t7,"['l3y1osw', 'l3yugy5', 'l3yp51q', 'l40z2ru', 'l40pci7', 'l40qllr', 'l40ulu7', 'l40urwm']",8

muwzy99,"This is probably really crazy to predict/speculate even for me but i can't help myself to get optimistic for next year, but i really want 44 countries to participate at Eurovision 2025  so here's my hopes for ESC 2025 and i wanna predict/speculate if these countries will use a national selection or not.


Albania🇦🇱, i kinda wanna see them use Kënga Magjike as a national selection instead of Festivali i Këngës, if Albania do decide to do another Festivali i Këngës just have more male singers compete like Eugent Bushpepa or Gjergj Kaçinari cause i want a male singer to represent Albania. 

Andorra🇦🇩, i really hope they return and use a national selection. 

Armenia🇦🇲, i really miss their national selection Depi Evratesil. 

Australia🇦🇺, maybe i'm not sure. 

Austria🇦🇹, now them returning to use a national selection would be a dream come true to me. 

Azerbaijan🇦🇿, i know that people don't like Azerbaijan participating at Eurovision but give hate towards the government and politics, don't give hate towards the singers from Azerbaijan otherwise i kinda wanna see a return of a national selection from them. 

Belgium🇧🇪, yes definitely. 

Bosnia & Herzegovina🇧🇦, they can either do a national selection or go internal, either way i want Salvatore Ganacci to represent them in ESC. 

Croatia🇭🇷, i always kinda liked Dora as their national selection, so keep using it please. 

Cyprus🇨🇾, at this point no cause they always say they will use a national selection but then go internal instead. 

Czechia🇨🇿, right now it's a huge maybe. 

Denmark🇩🇰, they are on the right track so keep using Dansk Melodi Grand Prix. 

Estonia🇪🇪, keep using Eesti Laul just change it to the ways it was before. 

Finland🇫🇮, UMK is always slaying so keep using it. 

France🇫🇷, they can go internal or have a national final it's always a 50/50 with me. 

Georgia🇬🇪, to be honest yes i wanna see them use a national selection. 

Germany🇩🇪, please go internal instead, but if they do decide to do a national selection instead make sure that Stefan Raab is the producer in it cause he knows what he is doing. 

Greece🇬🇷, i kinda wanna see the return of their national selection called MAD show or something like that. 

Iceland🇮🇸, they will probably keep using Söngvakeppnin as their national selection i just want them to have more song then 10, like have atleast 16 songs for once. 

Ireland🇮🇪, aslong as they use a new national selection instead of The Late Late Show i will be happy. 

Italy🇮🇹, ofcourse they will keep using Sanremo. 

Kazakhstan🇰🇿, i have wanted them to participate at Eurovision for 10 years now and make their big debut with a huge bang and have a national selection. 

Kosovo🇽🇰, after watching Festivali i Këngës on RTK edition i am confident that they debut at Eurovision 2025. 

Latvia🇱🇻, they will probably keep using Supernova as their selection process or they can just pull the Slovenia 2024 selection card by cancelling the planned national selection and just internally select Markus Riva instead. 

Lithuania🇱🇹, they should use the national selection Eurovizija.LT again. 

Luxembourg🇱🇺, their Eurovision 2024 participation did go well and i'm happy they will use a national selection i just wish they hopefully have a song in luxembourgish. 

Malta🇲🇹, just internally select Aidan, if they go with a national selection have more male singers compete. 

Moldova🇲🇩, their auditions is always a delight to watch so i hope they keep using national selections. 

Monaco🇲🇨, they will probably go internal or maybe have what San Marino does and hopefully have a song in the monégasque language. 

Montenegro🇲🇪, yes! with a national selection, that's all.  

The Netherlands🇳🇱, i'm probably the only one who wants them to do a national selection again, then again if they decide to withdraw after what happend this year i don't blame them whatsoever. 

North Macedonia🇲🇰, internally select Bobi Andonov please.  

Norway🇳🇴, keep using Melodi Grand Prix. 

Poland🇵🇱, i have no idea to be honest. 

Portugal🇵🇹, keep using Festival da Canção. 

Romania🇷🇴, probably not. 

San Marino🇸🇲, i want Una Voce per San Marino to be their national selection as long as humanly possible. 

Serbia🇷🇸, Pesma za Evroviziju has become a favorite national selection for me so yes keep using it. 

Slovenia🇸🇮, i hope they use their national selection EMA again. 

Spain🇪🇦, yes please keep using Benidorm Fest. 

Sweden🇸🇪, Melodifestivalen is literally why i am here so they will keep using it. 

Switzerland🇨🇭, same story here as with The Netherlands i really miss their national selection. 

Ukraine🇺🇦, they will keep using Vidbir.

There was a lot of rap this year in UMK and that is unfortunate as I don't really like it much either, but the truth is that rap is probably still the most popular genre of music in Finland. I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of applicants sent rap songs to them. I don't mind that they reserve slots for different genres as long as they choose the songs and the artists that are the best and I think in the past they have proven to have good taste. Then again they shouldn't be just choosing artists who are already established. They do have the stage experience needed, but they might not feel fresh or not care about ESC that much. 


Well, we'll see about next year. Yle published a speculative article today about the state of ESC and what it means for next year. It was said that UMK would be held regardless of whether we take part in ESC, but it was clear the UMK team was not happy about the current situation. Their main concern was safety.

iamamiwhoamiMgO,"My way's probably not gonna be popular, but this is what makes me vote for a song:

I vote for songs I like ONLY if they fill at least 2 of the following criteria in a way I deem as good and deserving of voting. The importance of each criteria for me is not the same as well as the amount of forgiving to songs that don't fill certain criteria. For the last one, you could maybe say I'm a sort of a hypocrite. Well, liking certain music IS subjective, after all.

The criteria:

1. The song's message is NOT about love/peace/romance/look at how sexy i am/look at how strong i am/feminism/acceptance. Not that there's anything wrong with these messages, yes? It's just I've seen these topics a million times with mostly cheesy/cringey/chatgpt-like lyrics, and I'd personally like to see something different.



2. The song does not include English or doesn't have English to be the language of most of its lyrics, because I really appreciate it whenever countries sing in their languages.



3. The singer(s) singing well. Obviously if the singer is sick/has technical issues/etc. I could understand it. But being too reliant on playback/backing vocals/dancing/shock factor/etc. is something I find hard to ignore.



4. Having a modest staging. By modest I mean to have outfits that don't reveal much and a performance without many effects/pyro/epilepsy/dancing/gimmicks/cringe.



5. The song has traditional elements in it. Preferably in the melody, but could be in the lyrics/dance/outfits/decor.



Again, this list varies a lot from each song and it is not black and white. In reality, I usually vote for 0-2 songs.

JustAGirlDi,"There are some categories I’d vote for, but for different reasons:

1. Songs in native languages. I know they are less likely to win, and I honestly think that sucks. Having all songs in English would rob Eurovision of the diversity and uniqueness. We have all the songs translated in the app and online so it’s not like we can’t know what a song means. This way countries can include their folklore and national identity and it’s a way to learn about each other.

2. Upbeat happy songs. The world is not in a great place right now, lots of us are struggling. Is a song makes me feel happy, makes me forget my worries, makes me dance and sing along even if I don’t understand the lyrics, I think it’s done a great job as a song. Music is not about checking a musical tickbox, it’s about making listeners feel what you want them to feel. In these times I want a song that makes me feel happy.

3. Uniqueness, which is part of 1 and 2. If a song sounds like every other song then I’m not likely to notice it between all the identical songs. Go crazy. Stand out.

4. Meaningful message. Not mandatory 100%, but it’s nice to have a song with a good message, like making something of yourself, standing up for yourself, or bringing out your inner strength. Just not failed love ballads. Not my thing personally. 

Songs I am less likely to vote for:

1. Generic pop songs. Ironically, the songs the jury are most likely to love. I’m talking about songs that will be elevator music in a few months, sounds like any other song and talks about breakups or fighting for love. They don’t stand out. It’s not bad music, just not special.

It’s all my personal opinion 🤷🏻‍♀️. And figuring out whether you want your song to be a jury favourite or a public favourite. The 2 don’t seem to always agree.

Good luck ☺️",l3ibae3,1715386216.0,2024-05-11T10:10:16,t3_1cotafe,t3_1cotafe,[],0

However, I have to confess that Rim Tim Tagi Dim is not my favourite song of the year. It's barely in my top10, which definitely means I consider it a good song, as it's a really competitive year. Yet, it's good more in a fun, rock way, rather than having deep lyrics as you say (I don't find them deep or creative at all) or particularly interesting music or vocals which I value a lot. It's just good and fun. It's a very Eurovision-esque song, which is why I believe is going to win, but for me that's not enough, especially when a very similar style song was the televote winner last year. I just want something fresh, something different, and preferably a song in its native language since we have so many this year.

This is by no means a hate comment for Croatia. As I said, I still find it a good song and it deserves to win for many reasons. It is just that I support other songs more. I totally respect that you're supporting your country, as I also support mine this year for the first time (fellow Balkan, also warm, with only one win 19 years ago, haha).

As a Balkan I support other Balkan countries and I'd really like you to be right in your first comment about Bosnia & Herzegovina, Montenegro and North Macedonia coming back.

Like if it was competing for, say, Germany or Austria and heck if it was competing in ANY year of 2021-2022-2023 it wouldn't have been a contender and for rightful reasons, even if it is a good song and it's enjoyable it's not like impactful enough the way Zitti e Buoni or Cha Cha Cha are.

Chickolata,"Just out of curiosity, why wouldn't you trust it?

While we're on the topic of travel recommendations, the whole of Adriatic Coast is worth visiting (although that doesn't mean that there are no gems further inland, such as the Plitvice Lakes, just to name one), but I would recommend visiting either in spring/early summer or late summer/early autumn, because the weather is still nice but it's not so crowded. Even the places such as Dubrovnik are much more bearable then.

EDITED TO ADD: if I had to choose, I would choose the islands (but that's a personal preference), particulary Mljet, Vis, Šolta and such. Extremely beautiful, with good traffic connections (Vis being the furthest from the coast), less crowded, a lot of piece and quite, but that also means no clubs and a general lack of night life, so it kinda depends on what type of travel experiences people prefer. Another favorite of mine is Istria, especially the interior with a lot of picturesque little towns and villages, although the same thing about a lack of night life applies there as well, as far as I know (with the caveat that it's much easier to reach bigger population centers from there if you want more of a city vibe).

(TLDR: Although Split is one of those places which are more conservative than certain other parts of Croatia, I would say the chances of something happening to a LGBTQ+ person is in all likelihood pretty much the same as in Zagreb, Rijeka, Dubrovnik, Istria. Generally speaking, in Croatia transphobia is stronger than homophobia, IMO)

Oh, I'm Croatian, so I understand what you're trying to say. I just wasn't sure whether you were thinking of safety issues or general travel experiences when you said you wouldn't trust it.

I'll try not to veer too much into topics more appropriate for other subreddits, but since we're all talking here about visiting Croatia, especially with regards to the possibility of Eurovision 2025, I'm just going to leave this here for anyone thinking about traveling here (if it's not appropriate for this subreddit, I apologise):


Actually, Split is pretty safe, it's just that it sometimes gets an unrealistically bad reputation (but getting into regional prejudices/xenophobia and the media culture would be a matter for another subbredit). In 2022, the Split-Dalmatian County was placed 13th on the crime-rate list (out of 20 Croatian Counties - the City of Zagreb and the Zagreb County were treated as one entity in that list because they fall within the same police jurisdiction), which means that the Split-Dalmatian County was the 8th safest, with 12 counties (including Istria, the Rijeka and Kvarner region etc. etc.) having more crimes per capita. Regarding hate crimes, again more hate crimes happened in Zagreb, Istria, Rijeka/Kvarner and some other places, although the number is almost identical.

 The data is from 2022, but I don't think there's a reason to think something has changed drastically.

That being said, for those thinking of visiting Croatia, fear not, even the region with the highest crime rate is still, by and large, safe because Croatian crime rates are low across the board (excluding corruption in politics - so technically you're in a bigger danger of getting bribed than assaulted in Croatia).
 
Regarding LGBTQ+ topics, sure, Zagreb is more open-minded, being Croatia's melting pot, but I know plenty of open-minded people in the Croatian South as well, especially in the last 15 years, with the advent of the modern mass tourism and the exposure that comes with it, and the changing generations; although there's still a lot of biggots. The actual ratio of the conservatives vs the open-minded is hard to guage though, but I don't think I would be too much off if I said that conservatives still form a majority. 

But from my experience, conservatism exists on a spectrum and most of homophobes in the South would, for example, vote against the gay marriage (or would abstain from voting, which is what in reality a lot of Croatian people did with the Marriage Referendum) but are not keen on violence. Last 12 Pride parades have proceeded with no incidents and I, for the life of me, can't remember hearing/reading about a single incident against LGBTQ+ people in the last 5 years, probably more, which kinda vibes with the hate crimes statistics mentioned above (although the question remains how many unreported crimes there were, not only in Split but country-wide). Meaning, even those that might not like you don't tend to do much about it beyond maybe giving you a side-eye, if even that, especially if you're a paying customer in the region heavily reliant on tourism, where hospitality is everything. In the end, I don't think there's more LGBTQ+ people per capita anywhere else in Croatia than on the Dalmatian island of Hvar in the summer lol.

I mean, I'm not going to guarantee personal safety to any LGBTQ+ person walking in ""that t-shirt"" or engaging in PDA in Split, just as I can't guarantee that there won't be someone hurling insults at you, because I could see that happening; but honestly, I wouldn't make such guarantees anywhere in Croatia considering I could see that exact scenario happening in Zagreb, Rijeka, Osijek, because there's always a chance of encountering someone willing to try to beat their beliefs into you.

And just to add, I feel that generally in Croatia transphobia is stronger than homophobia, probably due to reasons such as exposure and the fact that trans-friendly campaigns are comparatively a newer phenomenon.

Not having lived the entirety of my life as a LGBTQ+ person, I'm well aware of the fact that I do have a straight privilege and that my experiences are different, which is why I tried to look at the statistics. I'm not saying that life in general is not better in Zagreb for a non-cis non-straight person. I know that some of my LGBTQ+ friends moved to Zagreb because they felt they could be more true to themselves there and meet more people with the same sexuality, but their negative experiences had more to do with a lack of understanding/judgement from people around them (although my friends from Zagreb also had similar complaints, but the bigger the city, the freer you are) and wanting to meet more people of the same sexuality and experience a bigger gay scene, and not because of reasons such as physical/verbal assaults.

I like the idea of your heart. Definitely something to start with. A 3D render of it with a Swiss shade of red and a metallic texture, I think would work really nicely. It would be simplistic, but not boring.

Nick_esc,"North Macedonia 🇲🇰 and Montenegro 🇲🇪 have expressed their interest in returning next year, and if Croatia 🇭🇷 wins, then I’m almost sure they will. Bosnia & Herzegovina 🇧🇦 also expressed interest in returning in 2025, but it’s more difficult to happen imo. 

Romania 🇷🇴 will probably return, considering how close they were to participating this year. 

Bulgaria 🇧🇬 will return if they can find a sponsor or an artist who can cover the costs of participation (like in 2022). 

Monaco 🇲🇨 became a EBU member and has allocated money for Eurovision since 2022, so a return in 2025 is very possible. 

Andorra 🇦🇩 and Turkey 🇹🇷 have low chances of returning. 

As for the countries who might withdraw in 2025, I would say Czechia 🇨🇿, Slovenia 🇸🇮 and Latvia 🇱🇻 are the ones to watch out.

🇧🇦: they want to come back, depends entirely on wether they can work something out with the EBU regarding their debts

🇧🇬: depends on their ability to find a sponsor

🇹🇷: could potentially see them back as a sort of attempt for Erdogan to increase his quickly decreasing popularity, but most likely we will see them only after 2028

SkyGinge,"Feels a bit early to do this to me, but oh well. 

**Probably Returning:**

**Monaco:** Only reason they didn't participate this year was lack of time to organise around them getting their membership accepted. Strongly suspect they'll be back next year, especially if Luxembourg qualify like they're likely to this year.

**North Macedonia:** They're still participating in Junior Eurovision, and they have at least given the appearance of being positive about returning to the main Eurovision too. They even had some budget set aside for ESC this year before they used some anniversary of the broadcaster as a reason not to. Not guaranteed as they could always find new excuses/continue to struggle with funding, but I'm thinking that ESC will try to push towards being a bit cheaper next year and hopefully that will enable them to return. 

**Montenegro:** Same as above, apart from has been more positive about returning more recently, potentially even with an NF. Again funding will be the kicker.

**Could go either way:**

**Australia:** Heavy dependent on external funding which seems to be a lot less this year than other years (see Electric Fields' low budget music video, lack of promotional budget).

**Czechia:** Also dependent on external funding. The NF seems to be getting slightly better budget/coverage every year so hopefully they stick around. 

**Romania:** Not a clue on this one. The broadcaster could go either way, not sure they care enough about the Romanian fanbase to want to prioritise making a return and they also struggle budgetarily. 

**Bulgaria:** The ultimate wildcards, absolutely no clue. Could return out of the blue or could stay away for a long time. 

**Kazahkstan:** Would require a special invitation as a guest broadcaster not in the EBU. They're planning on returning to JESC as they took last year off whilst sorting something to do with their country code - they would probably be eager to participate in adult Eurovision especially if Australia drop out. 

**Others:**

**Azerbaijan:** Could withdraw following another NQ, but I think it's more likely they just reform their selection process from what I've seen/read from Azeri fans.

**Bosnia & Herzegovina:** It's great that they've recently said they want to return, but they have to basically fix their broadcaster, pay off fines/sanctions against them from the EBU and then also fund a participant, so I don't think it's likely any time soon. Sadly.

**Israel:** I think a lot of the 'Israel are going to withdraw' predictions are hopium. The only way Israel withdraws is if the war on Gaza drags on longer than most of us are expecting and drains resources too much, if it escalates further with Iran and others, or if the EBU do decide that KAN has violated public broadcaster rules (which they haven't, at least to the level that would get them suspended). 

**Kosovo:** Would love to see them in the contest but it's unclear if/when they'll have their membership accepted. 

**Latvia:** Could withdraw over continued poor results, but I've not seen anything concrete about this outside of doomsaying.",l0vz0de,1713879582.0,2024-04-23T23:39:42,t3_1cb46yy,t3_1cb46yy,[],0

I think Latvia might not be a sure participant, especially if they don’t get into the finals this year. Europe did them so dirty for so long, it’s best for Latvia to stay out of the contest for a few years, sort things out and then return stronger than ever. 

Idk abt Australia, I don’t think that they have the same excitement and enthusiasm about Eurovision as they had before. Lack of funds is also the key factor. 

There won’t be any debuts in a while. Neither Kosovo nor Kazakhstan will join. Kosovo won’t participate as long as they aren’t recognized by all of participating countries. Kazakhstan has no intention to debut whatsoever, as they pulled out even from JESC, which was the closest they ever got to Eurovision. 

North Macedonia and Montenegro are for sure returning, and so is Monaco. Andorra int he other hand no. I think that it will take a lot more for Andorra to return. 

I can see Slovakia returning in 2026. if not even in 2025. Idk why but I think they will return soon (at least I hope so)

At this point, Romania is joining Bulgaria and Hungary in the non-returning club, as I don’t see Romania joining back in the near future. I can even see Türkiye or Hungary getting back before them. The lack of interest for Eurovision TVR has is criminal. 

Bosnia is not returning next year. I don’t see it happening, their broadcaster is still in chaotic condition and still lacks enough funds for Eurovision. I hope they finally resolve the problem that they’ve been dealing with for years. The only way it might happen is if Croatia wins next year.

Albania🇦🇱, i kinda wanna see them use Kënga Magjike as a national selection instead of Festivali i Këngës, if Albania do decide to do another Festivali i Këngës just have more male singers compete like Eugent Bushpepa or Gjergj Kaçinari cause i want a male singer to represent Albania. 

Andorra🇦🇩, i really hope they return and use a national selection. 

Armenia🇦🇲, i really miss their national selection Depi Evratesil. 

Australia🇦🇺, maybe i'm not sure. 

Austria🇦🇹, now them returning to use a national selection would be a dream come true to me. 

Azerbaijan🇦🇿, i know that people don't like Azerbaijan participating at Eurovision but give hate towards the government and politics, don't give hate towards the singers from Azerbaijan otherwise i kinda wanna see a return of a national selection from them. 

Belgium🇧🇪, yes definitely. 

Bosnia & Herzegovina🇧🇦, they can either do a national selection or go internal, either way i want Salvatore Ganacci to represent them in ESC. 

Croatia🇭🇷, i always kinda liked Dora as their national selection, right now i'm unsure how that will go cause this year of 2024 is supposedly the final year of Dora being hosted in Opatija according to the contract they did in 2021. 

Cyprus🇨🇾, at this point no cause they always say they will use a national selection but then go internal instead. 

Czechia🇨🇿, right now it's a huge maybe. 

Denmark🇩🇰, they are on the right track so keep using Dansk Melodi Grand Prix. 

Estonia🇪🇪, keep using Eesti Laul just change it to the ways it was before. 

Finland🇫🇮, UMK is always slaying so keep using it. 

France🇫🇷, they can go internal or have a national final it's always a 50/50 with me. 

Georgia🇬🇪, to be honest yes i wanna see them use a national selection. 

Germany🇩🇪, please go internal instead, but if they do decide to do a national selection instead make sure that Stefan Raab is the producer in it cause he knows what he is doing. 

Greece🇬🇷, i kinda wanna see the return of their national selection called MAD show or something like that. 

Iceland🇮🇸, they will probably keep using Söngvakeppnin as their national selection i just want them to have more song then 10, like have atleast 16 songs for once. 

Ireland🇮🇪, aslong as they use a new national selection instead of The Late Late Show i will be happy. 

Italy🇮🇹, ofcourse they will keep using Sanremo. 

Kazakhstan🇰🇿, i have wanted them to participate at Eurovision for 10 years now and make their big debut with a huge bang and have a national selection. 

Kosovo🇽🇰, after watching Festivali i Këngës on RTK edition i am confident that they debut at Eurovision 2025. 

Latvia🇱🇻, they will probably keep using Supernova as their selection process or they can just pull the Slovenia 2024 selection card by cancelling the planned national selection and just internally select Markus Riva instead. 

Lithuania🇱🇹, they should use the national selection Eurovizija.LT again. 

Luxembourg🇱🇺, if their Eurovision 2024 participation goes well they will use a national selection and hopefully have a song in luxembourgish. 

Malta🇲🇹, just internally select Aidan. 

Moldova🇲🇩, their auditions is always a delight to watch so i hope they keep using national selections. 

Monaco🇲🇨, they will probably go internal or maybe have what San Marino does and hopefully have a song in the monégasque language. 

Montenegro🇲🇪, yes! with a national selection, that's all.  

The Netherlands🇳🇱, i'm probably the only one who wants them to do a national selection again. 

North Macedonia🇲🇰, internally select Bobi Andonov please.  

Norway🇳🇴, keep using Melodi Grand Prix. 

Poland🇵🇱, i have no idea to be honest. 

Portugal🇵🇹, keep using Festival da Canção. 

Romania🇷🇴, probably not. 

San Marino🇸🇲, i want Una Voce per San Marino to be their national selection as long as humanly possible.

Slovenia🇸🇮, i hope they use their national selection EMA again. 

Spain🇪🇦, yes please keep using Benidorm Fest. 

Sweden🇸🇪, Melodifestivalen is literally why i am here so they will keep using it.

Now the Myth about Israel coming back the next year in 1981 and that being the reason they left is not so black and white as people may think. IF Morocco for example won or got Top 5 back in 1980, I highly doubt Israel would be the real reason they would leave.

Ill-Calligrapher-131,"Actually in Israel the English word propaganda is, or at least was when I lived there, used very commonly by Israelis to describe Israel’s international public diplomacy efforts.

This would also apply to explaining Israel’s version of Oct 7, including through song…

SkyGinge,"I'm hesitant to get all doom and gloom about things this early into the Eurovision calendar. From the current participating countries, the only ones I can see withdrawing next year would be:

* **Australia:** it's unclear exactly what their deal is for participation now, but it definitely feels like Electric Fields don't have masses of funding behind their participation at the moment. If they were to withdraw though I think the EBU would invite Kazakhstan or another associate member instead.
* **Czechia** because their participation is dependant on sponsorships which aren't guaranteed. But more likely they'd withdraw in 2026 as others have commented for political reasons. 
* **Georgia:** I'm not massively sold on this since they seem to be moving in a positive direction and there seems to be more momentum around their participants. But potentially another failure to qualify could tip them over the edge.
* **Iceland:** Depending on how long the current Gaza conflict goes on for, I could see Iceland dropping out for a year. They were the closest to withdrawing this year because of Israel's participation, and general public opinion isn't very happy with the way the national final and participation was ultimately handled.
* **Malta:** In the likelihood that they fail to qualify, I can see a slim chance of Malta withdrawing unless there's a return of the juries to the semi-finals in some capacity, given their statements last year after failing to qualify. 

However, the following countries have a decent chance of returning next year:

* **Monaco:** They previously said that they wanted to return, but were unable to do so this year due to the tight deadlines around the establishment of the new broadcaster ([source](https://eurovoix.com/2023/10/11/tvmonaco-editor-in-chief-explains-eurovision-2024-non-participation/)). There is a strong chance that we see them again next year.
* **Montenegro:** Dependent as ever on external funding, but they have spoken about intending on creating a new festival which could serve as a national final ([source](https://eurovoix.com/2024/01/06/montenegro-eyes-possible-eurovision-return-in-2025/))
* **North Macedonia:** They still participate in JESC, and their absence this year was explained as due to celebrating a jubilee of Macedonian broadcasting instead ([source](https://eurovoix.com/2023/12/06/north-macedonia-mrt-explains-absence-from-eurovision-2024/)). I remember one Macedonian community member saying that was a load of rubbish, but hopefully they will return next year given they are assigning funding still to Eurovision participation. 
* **Romania:** It's unclear how long their absence is going to be, but hopefully it won't be too long. Dependent on the broadcaster suddenly becoming competent, and also on external funding. Hopefully Romanian fan groups can pressure them into re-joining.
* **Bulgaria:** At the bottom of this list because who even knows lol, they are absolute wildcards and they could suddenly return without any warning, or they could stay away for a long time.

I'm hopeful that we at least stay at the same level of participation as this year, or better still push towards 40 participants again.",kyr7owl,1712663174.0,2024-04-09T21:46:14,t3_1bzkehl,t3_1bzkehl,[],0

Possible returning countries 

🇸🇰 already confirmed that they’re not coming back next year 

🇹🇷,🇭🇺 and 🇷🇺 would need a sudden change of government, which I find unlikely and 🇷🇺 would even need to re-join the EBU

🇧🇾 is a bit like the ones above, the ban that got them out on the last few years ends next year, however there’s no way in hell they’ll be back unless Lukashenko goes away

🇧🇦 needs to solve their financial problems which includes debt to the EBU, I don’t know how likely it is for them to have it solved in time to participate next year, but I have my doubts

🇲🇨 and 🇦🇩 could see 🇱🇺’s return as an incentive to come back, especially if Tali has a decent result 

🇲🇰 and 🇲🇪 will probably be back sometime in the near future 

🇷🇴 and 🇧🇬 are weird cases, because I never (completely) understood their withdrawal to begin with, however could easily see🇷🇴 back next year, don’t know about 🇧🇬 tho

🇲🇦 simply won’t happen


Possible debuting countries:

🇰🇿 and 🇱🇮 seem to have stopped trying 

🇫🇴 is trying to get EBU membership but I don’t think it’s doable given that they’re part of 🇩🇰

🇽🇰 has been showing good signs of a possible debut but there’s always “the issue” in them being accepted 

🇻🇦we would all love it but it ain’t happening 

🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿,🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 and 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 could only compete in a scenario in which 🇬🇧 didn’t participate as a single nation, could see it happening somewhere down the road, but definitely not next year

Rough-Flounder1949,"Countries that are no longer participating,

Romania, 
Could be back next year with how they worked their withdrawal, saying they had to solve some internal issues. So that does leave some hope.

North Macedonia,
They will return if the contest is hosted somewhere affordable, so not in Switzerland.

Montenegro,
Same as with North Macedonia, but then a bit more extreme. They came back for Italy which was probably one of the cheaper contests in recent years. So if its hosted in the Netherlands, France, Switzerland they wont come back either.

Bulgaria,
I dont really see it happening, unless we go to a really cheap country like Georgia or Greece next year. Where they basically wont have to pay much for trying.

Russia,
No wont come back

Belarus,
Could come back, but im 99% sure they wont.

Hungary,
Not with orban still as a head of government, but there seem to be some stirs in his rule atm. So we might see them back in the near future.

Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Not for as long as the Serbians Republics broadcaster refuses to give the funds to the Bosniaks who has a right to them. Honestly i dont see this happening unless the government changes there too.

Slovakia,
Well they wont come back

Türkiye,
When Erdogan leaves in 2028 or if he wants to appease people so they start liking him more again, then it could be next year.

Andorra,
Maybe if its hosted somewhere cheap

Monaco,
This is the only realistic return for now i think, since they seem to be interested and have the funding 

Morocco,
If Israel gets banned i would say 50/50, depending on if they will be okay with gay people on television. They would be an instant powerhouse and 100% qualifier though because of their diaspora.

Serbia and Montenegro and Yugoslavia,
Never, hopefully.

Countries that could debut,

Liechtenstein, 
They said no

Kosovo,
Maybe in 5-10 years

Kazakhstan,
This is realistic if the EBU wants to get in more participants to pay the fee 

Vatican,
No

Arab countries,
No for as long as Israel participates, if they are banned. Then maybe Lebanon and Jordan since the rest is probably too anti-gay to be participating.

Countries that could whitdraw,

Slovenia 
We know they have money issues and if Switzerlands host they will probably not show up, otherwise they might go

Latvia,
Well so many bad results will eventually make a broadcaster back out.

Czechia, 
We also know they have funding issues and also a lack of interest by the public. So this is a debate every year

Israel,
Maybe they are banned next year since public opinion is shifting very quickly

Moldova,
They aren't very whealty so a contest in Switzerland could make them back out.

So in the end i would say if this contest goes all according to the odds and politics progresses the way it does, we will see 5 withdrawal and 1 ( Monaco) come back. Meaning a total of 33 participants in Switzerland (winner according to the odds). If a country like Georgia wins then i would say 1 withdrawal and 5 comebacks ( Romania, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Monaco), plus maybe a Kazakhstan debut and Türkiye could return in Georgia case because Nutsa is from there. Meaning i could see between 41-43 participants in Georgia or similair poorer countries if one of them wins.",kyqlx0c,1712648432.0,2024-04-09T17:40:32,t3_1bzkehl,t3_1bzkehl,"['kyqvtcr', 'kyr5hpp']",2

Tundraful,"[This](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=Montenegro&country2=Switzerland) is a decent site for comparison, though it doesn't have Hotel stays specifically, you can compare the price of groceries, rent, travel, etc.

You can select various countries to compare but I started with Montenegro Vs Switzerland (as per someone's example above).

As a brief example, this site claims that:

- A meal at an inexpensive restaurant would be 9.50€ in Montenegro, while the same meal in Switzerland would cost over 25€

- A one-way local transport ticket would be ~1€ in Montenegro, and would cost ~3.50€ in Switzerland

- Monthly rent for a 1 Bedroom apart in a City centre would be ~600€ in Montenegro, and would cost ~1800€ in Switzerland

You can select specific cities to compare which might make it more accurate, but I assume it is all approximate/averaged.

You can also look at the average monthly earnings which gives you a better idea of how high/low the cost of living is.

Russia is a mixed bag, they are imperialistic, and more of their own thing. They had a great deal of influence on Europe and vice-versa, however they aren't a true ally. I mean, if Russia shared European values and would actually become an ally that alliance would be relevant on a global level. EU+Russia would be a superpower in line with USA, China and India.

AmrakCL,"I mean, ESC is kind of gay, however there is nothing wrong with that. When a group is persecuted and suppressed then they try to express themselves wherever they can, Entertainment and fashion were common areas where gay people could thrive so it's only natural that they influenced ESC. I personally love the fact that people are free to be who ever they want here without any drama, and that everybody is on equal ground. 

For instance, Nemo is NB and nobody cares, they're free to be their best selves, and they will be judged solely based on their performance which corresponds to how much work they put in. On the other side you have Baby Lasagna who is a straight Catholic, and again, nobody cares because he's living his best life and spreading love and joy around him. Some would say that the two of should be antagonistic to each other but they look past the labels and are seen as individuals. That's the beauty of ESC, no matter our differences we're just humans there.

Mind you, there are toxic people everywhere who have nothing in their lives except the labels they put on themselves, and it's important that we recognise that and stand up against them within our ""own groups"" because otherwise we just give ammo to those that wish to spread hate.",kyqx79r,1712657024.0,2024-04-09T20:03:44,t3_1bytwre,t1_kyqvq0i,[],0

But in order to survive, there must be improvements to the format:

- make the orchestra optional with more flexibility in instruments. This must also ensure entries in a wild variety of genres from various cultures.

- make the vote more democratic with partial jury, partial public

- language definitely has to be flexible

- do something about that darn relegation!
