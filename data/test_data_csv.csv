The last deacde seen it be systemically, culturally gutted to the point of farce. I spent my whole life there until the beginning of this year, and I can flat out tell you it is one of the least entertaining, most overrated cities I’ve spent time in.

It is closer to the classless, opulent hellscape that is Dubai than it is to Melbourne, let alone a London or a NYC. 

Bowling clubs are being priced out of existence by councils who want to rezone their footprints for high density multi-res.

Every music festival is dying because of massive expenditure increases for the same shit. Venues have disappeared like crazy - fuck, places like World Bar and Good God Small Club were amazing and are now just gone, replaced by overpriced cafes and shit pop up shops. 

There is a gross oversaturation of NIMBY boomers who reject public housing in every suburb. The money of the city all sits in the pockets of decrepit dinosaurs who hoard their wealth like dragons, and then complain that the only people who will work their local Cafe’s for $18 an hour while rent is $800 a week are living-assisted international students. 

I can honestly say that I have watched the decline of a great city in my lifetime, and Sydney is potentially the most devoid-of-life shitheap I have been in for quite some time.

1. Grids are boring, and even if Sydney is a bit spaghet with its roads, it shouldn't really upset anyone to the point of favouring Melbourne for that sole reason. Getting around is easy. We're not struggling because we have some angled roads.

3. Sydney already backhands Melbourne with the harbour alone, before you add in any other sites and points of interest. No one is flying to Melbourne to see anything of similar or even 1/10th of the popularity. Flying to Melbourne to see grid roads and have a coffee.

7.	The traffic moves too smoothly (nothing more exciting than sitting in traffic)
8.	Airport is five minutes from the CBD (needs to be at least an hour)
9.	No toll roads (I get hard every time I hear my toll road dongle beep)

I remember having to wait to use the hose in mornings, but that hasn't happened since I was a kid. I have still seen some decent early morning icicles hanging off of pivots and other irrigators in the last 10 or so years though.",l3em0wq,1715330890.0,2024-05-10T18:48:10,t3_1coh749,t1_l3e905l,[],0

And the stupid ""trackless trams"" aren't going to be limited to Stirling - if they prove to be successful (and God help us if they deem them to be so) they're going to be used elsewhere.

The ""trackless trams"" are only a possible addition. They won't work unless having a dedicated lane or better traffic signalling. That's another can of worms.
