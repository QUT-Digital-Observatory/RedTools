MerakDubhe,"2015 is my favourite edition. To a different extent, I liked all the songs except for two or three. All songs were tasteful (I don’t enjoy camp), and it gave us some masterpieces. Loïc Nottet didn’t get enough credit for Rhythm Inside, a song that you can still listen today and it doesn’t sound old. Brilliant.

I’ve just watched the opening and I’ve started crying. The music, the beauty, Austria. Few times an opening act has captured the essence of the host city as perfectly as that one.

RPark_International,"2013 and especially 2014 I’ve always considered very strong years, and at the time I was disappointed with most of the 2015 standard, feeling it was a drop, but I decided to buy it on DVD and my opinion has grown a lot since then, and thought it was a fantastic production. I especially enjoyed the interval act, and I wonder if it was a little bit inspired by the film Whiplash, from the previous year.

One thing I would change (if I could) would be the Dutch song, the verses were good but it was let down by a repetitive chorus, an unflattering dress and bizarre direction, such a shame as I’m a huge fan of Trijnte.",ll1cwrz,1725220000.0,2024-09-02T05:46:40,t3_1f6ftz7,t3_1f6ftz7,[],0

GianMach,"I hold very mixed feelings for 2015. On the one hand, the roster of songs was really strong (especially compared to some of the years before) and it even had a few at the time really modern songs competing (I'd say Rhythm Inside was ahead of its time even). 

On the other hand, I find the live performances of 2015 almost unwatchable due to how dire the production was. The direction looks as if there were just three poorly placed camera's in the entire venue and most acts just switch between those with seemingly no further thought to it. The stage was tiny (it looks like there wasnt even room to have the backing singers sing backstage, as there were so many acts where they just stand in a corner and don't contribute to the act whatsoever) and the lighting wasn't great either due to the lights around the stage that weren't even that impressive visually either. Also in many shots the LED showed unwanted interference with the camera's while we havent really seen that that much in the years just before or after 2015. The whole thing is just ugly and painful to watch imo. Especially mashed between the beautiful shows that 2014 and 2016 were... 2015 just falls flat.",ll1rm52,1725224946.0,2024-09-02T07:09:06,t3_1f6ftz7,t3_1f6ftz7,[],0

linmanfu,"While I do like many of the 2015 songs, I think the best part was that incredible introduction, which started with a very stereotypical vision of Austria (an orchestra playing in a stately park), but then included a variety of aspects of the country, both traditional and liberal. The staging was technically superb and the fan videos were so fun. It wasn't flawless: there was a supposed 'joke' about speaking Chinese that should never been broadcast, and I am really not a fan of Conchita. But I have watched the opening half hour dozens of times because I think it's a really stirring vision of what Europe could be. I know I'm being emotionally manipulated but I don't care!

As a Brit, Vienna 2015 also has a special place in my heart as the last time that I watched Eurovision with confidence that the UK's future was in Europe. By the time the 2016 contest happened, I was involved in the pro-EU campaign for the Brexit referendum and feeling pretty pessimistic about our chances. I skipped the rest of the decade because it just made me feel so awful to see a party that my country was leaving.

PraetorIt,"'Hate' is the wrong word. More than anything, people here probably don't like the Melodifestivalen model.

I think the songs sent by SVT are very commercial, which certainly have a hold on the average audience, but are less appreciated by other types. It can be said that they seem prepackaged, plasticized and not very particular. The fact the authors are often the same probably doesn't help.

Also, it's worth remembering that:

1) Sverige is the only nation that, since the change of rules, has not sent a song in its native language. Which on the one hand has become a meme, on the other hand leads to antipathy, considering that the greater linguistic diversity that has occurred in recent years is appreciated.

2) Regarding the comments in the sub, this year a couple of threads opened by 'funny' Swedish users have had an impact, since they claiming the undisputed superiority of Melodifestivalen.

Side note: In the past, some have explained that the situation in Sverige is complicated, due to commercial and Anglophile matters (*cough*). But that is a reflection I leave to the Swedes.",ljl556a,1724438073.0,2024-08-24T04:34:33,t3_1ezgj63,t3_1ezgj63,['ljlqvnw'],1

All these songs have a story, personality and soul. Something the songs from Sweden have been severely lacking.

DetArMax,"Sweden (as a country, not just in Eurovision) is really good at producing high quality pop music. So every year they (we) send a well *produced* pop song, but the other aspects of a song are not necessarily up to the same standards. Juries, generally being music professionals, appreciate the quality of music production in a way the televoters generally don't. Televoters tend to prioritize other things.

So Sweden's high quality but often generic pop gets more jury points than the general public think they deserve, which makes people dislike Sweden.

I totally think Sweden sends boring songs and I really want us to send something more fun. It would probably tank the jury score, but I don't really see why winning at Eurovision should be so important.",ljlnjo5,1724444063.0,2024-08-24T06:14:23,t3_1ezgj63,t3_1ezgj63,[],0
LucarioGamesCZ,"This is probably gonna be buried, but let me give my take.

Sweden is disliked due to the percieved mismatch between quality and results. There is a pretty universal dislike of most of the stuff they send. It all sounds samey, safe, over-polished and almost everything is produced by the same few producers, not leaving room for almost any artists to come in with their own songs.

This, by itself is however not the main issue. The issue is that Sweden does exceedingly well in ESC with this stuff. I have this thing which i call ""The North Macedonia test"" which basically looks at a song and tries to determine, if it would do as well if it was sent by a no-name artist from NM. For example, Rim Tim Tagi Dim passes this test because i honestly believe that if NM sent the song, it would do just as well. Sweden is the complete opposite. Most of the stuff they send is bland and not that interesting, yet it still does amazing just because it has the ""Sweden"" label on it. 

Due to their consistently stellar results with their entries, it's inconceivable that Melfest will change anytime soon. When listening to each new edition of MGP, UMK or so on, in almost every year, they have someting new and interesting. With Sweden, you can pretty safely guess what will they have in their nf each year. Without fail. And that's why we don't care. That's why we dislike.

In 2022 and 2023, they selected Cornelia Jakobs and Loreen, both of whom had excellent songs and staging, as well as two women in a row winning Melfest after years of male pop songs dominating Melfest [Not counting the Mamas because unfortunately they didn't get the chance to go to ESC.

I love alternative stuff, stuff in different languages, stuff that's weird, but also, stuff that's genuine. And Sweden doesn't do amazing in these factors, sure. But I also value countries putting in effort. I value production and the development of technology in music, especially as I also really like electropop. I value staging, and as a hobbyist musician of ten years, I value good (or atleast competent) singing. And say what you want about Sweden, but in THESE factors, they DO always deliver.

Sweden isn't perfect, they could take slightly more risk, sure, I agree. But if you really want to see a change, the only solution is to change jury criteria to value alternative or folksy stuff more, or to value lyrical meaning more, as opposed to production value and professionalism, which is what they currently seem to value, rather than hate on Sweden for doing what they're good at.

Since then I've felt the songs from Sweden have been okay but don't have much personality, presence, or uniqueness. There's been several Melfest songs, including Loreen with Statements, that I felt were absolutely brilliant and weren't more of the same overproduced stuff.

I love Ukraine every year when they send a well produced song with a personal and cultural flair. I love when countries send something different. I adored Käärijä, it was exactly what I was looking for in a fun Eurovision song. Jamala was exactly what I love in a ballad, that emotion was clear. I haven't felt any of that for Swedish songs since Måns where his song felt like an anthem.

schneidm21,"I typically like Sweden's song every year and Melfest is always well produced! It remains the best national final and each year it is awesome to see thousands of people waving balloons simultaneously. Lol.

My only minor criticism of Sweden is that sometimes a lot of the songs sound the same.  Somehow they are all different songs - and yet they kind of just seem similar.  Part of that is that the same song writers write a lot of the songs.

I wish Sweden would pick a song that was kind of ""new"" or ""different"" or ""unique."" I remember Latvia 2015 and thinking it was unique enough to be fresh but definitely designed to be a song and not a gimmick.

In terms of people critiquing the Melfest production, I think people just love Melfest and have an expectation that the production value be really high each year.  In that way, Melfest is a victim of its own success.  No one critiques the production values or show in San Marino, for example, because we already expect it to be low.  There are no expectations.

With Melfest, no matter how good the songs are I think many find it irritating that a large chunk of songs that compete and qualify for the finals tend to have the same group of writers which include: Jimmy Joker, Thomas G:son, Dino Medanhodžić, Joy and Linnea Deb, Anderz Wrethov. While they've produced some great songs over the years, there's a pattern where the songs themselves are usually jury and radio friendly songs that are (mostly) in English. I don't blame artists at all for working with those writers and that's just how it is but maybe Melfest could limit how many songs individual writers submit to even out the playing field more? 

With what they send to Eurovision, at times Swedish entries can lack depth and feel inauthentic to many people and mask that with being well-produced and staged.

SyndicatePhoenix,"Melfest is mostly done for Swedish  Audiance,but since Melfest is used to pick a song for ESC, people confuse it for ""melfest = specifically made for ESC and nothing else"". Then they get annoyed of Melfest songs being mostly pop-songs (even rock songs will always have a hint of pop in them), as well as being annoyed at the fact that most songs get that specific Melfest feel in them  (I...honestly...cannot explain the Melfest-feel of the songs. If you watch Melfest for long enough,you will start to recognize the specific tune all songs have regardless of genre (I think I saw some listeners use the term ""melofied"" in the past), but I lack words how to explain that tune...  Sweden also tends to uh...write songs for other countries. A loooot of other counties.  Or at least have be somehow involved in them.... 

Those who decide to not slap in that Melfest tune usually end in Second Chance or get thrown out from competition real quick (Loreen - Statements is one of those examples...). Sweden audience (that listens and watches Melfest) want  a specific tune (mostly pop) or at least pop-ified song (even if it's rock), so why change the formula? For now it works.The day it dosen't, it will be changed (yes,a lot of people whined when Sweden was yeeted from ESC in 2010).

Dosen't help current formula made Melfest quite successful on ESC stage (and brought us many wins) so...popular = easier to hate. 

  
After Sweden's famous 2010 kick-out from ESC  (that brought changes to Melfest changes that made Sweden the powerhouse we know today) there were some songs that were either a bit unusual or had popular singers that failed.  Or simply failed for other reasons like bad vocals...

even when Germany does something super unique like last year ,they get so outshined by sweden... that's also because sweden can get big names like Loren or M&M

But using San Remo winner as a possible Eurovision entrant makes Italian entries actual examples of Italian music and culture.

Personally, I'd rather have Eurovision entries that are an actual example of what is at least somewhat popular in the specific country. It doesn't have to be ethnic but there should be something that you can recognise immediately what country is this. Like Estonia, the only other country that could have sent that is Finland. Finland - while the song itself could have been written anywhere else, the artists and idea of performance is inherently Finnish. Ireland with pagan symbols. France was typical French ballad. Norway with their song not only in Norwegian but adapted a centuries old legend. Serbia singing about resistance and their national symbol. Slovenia singing a story inspired by historical persona from Slovenian history (Veronika of Desenice). Ukraine showing their culture over and over again while also showing diversity in genres.

Glad_Description1851,"I always find this particular criticism of Sweden a bit odd, because it seems to illustrate that people aren't really familiar with modern Swedish culture. I do have my own issues with some Swedish ESC entries, and in theory I agree with plenty of points you made. But the fact is that radio-friendly, polished pop music *is* very much modern Swedish culture. Sweden is one of the biggest music exporters globally. Plenty of the global or Anglo radio-friendly pop, that we tend to assume is just ""American music"" or whatever, has Swedish music producers behind it. Scandi pop literally is cultural and has been for a long time.

In that sense, I'd argue it *does* constitute ""an actual example of what is at least somewhat popular in the specific country."" Say what you want about Sweden's ESC entries, but many of them are absolutely recognizable as Swedish to me, sometimes even instantly so lol. It's just that the style also happens to be globalized so maybe you don't perceive the sound as Swedish, but frankly that's no one's fault. Whether we personally hate it or love it, it's a Swedish sound. And, rather than saying that the entries are ""created with Eurovision in mind"", I'd argue it's more accurate to say that they're created with Melodifestivalen in mind. Because in some respects, Melodifestivalen is a bigger deal than Eurovision itself in Sweden. It has a lot of impact on the music charts in the country, and typically attracts more Swedish viewers than ESC itself does. It's a big deal and goes on for a long time.

That being said, the Swedish music scene is of course bigger than that of Melodifestivalen, and I'd also love to see more variety. I'd love to hear the Swedish language in the contest and as someone who loves Nordic folk/ethnic music and folk culture, it'd be awesome to see some of that as well. But I'd settle for seeing a bigger variety of Swedish artists from the modern music scene (because while I maintain that the ESC songs are in fact Swedish music, it's not the only type of Swedish music to exist). ",ljrhwtw,1724533931.0,2024-08-25T07:12:11,t3_1ezgj63,t1_ljqgghd,['ljrjlfr'],1

Also, it is noticeable how interesting was Eurovision in the 2000s in terms of winning countries: during 8 years in a row, new countries had won (Estonia, Latvia, Turkey, Ukraine, Greece, Finland, Serbia, Russia). Personally, I hope that some new countries will win in the near future, but also I want some countries that had not won for a long time (like France) to also win.",ld5dzmd,1720970317.0,2024-07-15T01:18:37,t3_1e2fnwj,t3_1e2fnwj,['ld5e12p'],1

DaraVelour,"In years 2001-2008 we got a new winning country. Most from Eastern Europe and Balkans (adjacent). Since 2012 the only Eastern European country that won was Ukraine. Azerbaijan was a fluke, possible vote rigging and a song written by Swedes, so not even authentic. Re-introduction of juries lowered the chances of the rest non-winning countries to win by a lot. The only new winner in last decade was Portugal. The possibility of getting first time winner is low, really low, especially with how things went in recent years, when two years in a row nobody is able to catch up to jury winner and juries are biased a lot towards mainstream western European (sounding) music. Portugal was the only non mainstream sounding song that won jury in last decade. Even The Code is moderately mainstream sounding. At least more than Portugal 2017. And it's in English. Portugal was the only non-English song winning juries in last decade.",ld7fyqg,1720996474.0,2024-07-15T08:34:34,t3_1e2fnwj,t3_1e2fnwj,['ld7fzk7'],1

Lithuania feels more likely than Armenia, and I'd love to see them join Estonia and Latvia. It doesn't feel right that they got their wins back to back but Lithuania's still waiting 20+ years later.

But as much as I'd love to see Lithuania win, I'd want to see Armenia win first. They and Georgia have had plenty of winners in JESC (5 between them), it's about time they win the adult contest.

LeoLH1994,"A great song contest, though there were too many ballads and there were not enough fun songs or lingual diversity. However the fun songs were amongst the show’s best, like Sweden, Israel, Slovenia, Serbia, Belgium and most of all Australia (shame about ours but it was the lyrics, lack of professionalism and name sounding like a Nike away kit that was the problem - Destiny proved that that type of music can work), the design of the show was done really well and the atmosphere was magnificent. I have a lot of issues with Million Voices though I do admit it was one of the best ballads of that year. Conchita was magnificent in their roles and it was a great year.

Building Bridges, including a long one from Vienna to Vienna hahaha


Måns winning with his original interaction with the back screen without overusing it (looking at you, Sergey)


Belgium was my favorite. I really rapapaped with it


Neither Germany nor Austria were among my favourites but they didn't deserve the 0 points. Especially the Makemakes and their burning fake piano didn't deserve to become the zeroes of our time.

Unpopular opinion: UK was one of my favorites. I know it's generally not liked but I will defend it wholeheartly


Switzerland started their NQ streak with a weak song


Armenia was also a favourite of mine, I can't deny it (as they said: dooon't deeeenyy)

San Marino realized that they can send other artists than Valentina but they sadly didn't qualify. But still they gave us the iconic moment of the hall shouting ""no!""


Cyprus really was touching and I think it deserved better

Australia debuted with a banger!

 other memorable songs: Hour of the Wolf, I'm Alive, Goodbye to Yesterday (another favourite of mine, though I thought the singing was a bit off), Golden Boy (alright, gotta go, 3 minutes, bye bye), Grande Amore (Timeless banger!), This Time (cheesy song with ONE KISS...and you will see what you miss), Adio...

NQ's that I wanted to qualify: Netherlands (nice song to walk along), Czechia (how did this not qualify??), Finland (come on, they rocked the stage, even though it was the shortest song ever! Maybe they were too ahead of their time and would have qualified if it was 2024)",lbi7366,1720041830.0,2024-07-04T07:23:50,t3_1duatmg,t3_1duatmg,[],0

Any-Where,"I think to really put things into a hot take perspective:

- I find Heroes to be an extremely annoying song
- As charming as Mans is as a personality, I am not a fan of his singing voice, especially in the verses 
- The performance started a bit of a trend of middling songs relying on expensive and elaborate staging to mask them a bit
- If I was to rank the winners since 2000 the only thing stopping Heroes from being dead last is that Believe exists.

And yet, I would STILL rank it in the Top 10 songs of the night. Meanwhile, two of the songs I would place above it scored 0 points. Nightmare of a year in that regards. It's not that the songs are bad as such, it's just so many of them blend together and become forgettable.

For the positives, both Italy and Belgium were great and the winner should have ideally been one of them, Australia made a very strong first impression, a bit of a guilty pleasure but Golden Boy is actually my favourite Israeli entry (and it's by an extremely wide margin), and there are still some other decent songs in the mix that may not be the first songs I click on the playlist but wouldn't skip.",lbfl5wz,1720009650.0,2024-07-03T22:27:30,t3_1duatmg,t3_1duatmg,"['lbfta8r', 'lbu78he']",2

MarsNirgal,"Moldova 2018 was just amazing. Probably the most complex staging ever and they executed it flawlessly. 

Greece 2021 was great as well, maybe not as perfect but also insane.

I also love France 2021, deceivingly simple, but hard to pull off and very effective. 

Going a bit more to the past, Spain 2014 andAlbania 2012 were fantastic.

Ukraine has been great lost of years, but in terms of stage concepts Ukraine 2014 and Ukraine 2011 are probably the best.

Azerbaijan 2013 is probably the only staging that could look good in that year. 

And even if I hate the song, Armenia 2016 was a masterpiece of camerawork.",l8v8905,1718549798.0,2024-06-17T00:56:38,t3_1dh3whw,t3_1dh3whw,['l8v89qb'],1

But for me it’s about staging complementing the song like Netherlands 2019 or Denmark 2018, which was not something super complex but worked out well in the end. Last year's Loreen was great too. ",l8v8run,1718550003.0,2024-06-17T01:00:03,t3_1dh3whw,t3_1dh3whw,['l8v8t9s'],1

The visuals, man.

1. the United Kingdom of 1981 would like a word about Maria Naumova xD

2. props have been used as early as 1957, bu yeah, not in the same way as it is now

3. Diva - yes, absolutely, but let's not forget Pall Oskar from the year prior - I think his song marked the beginning of the camp era of Eurovision

4. Turkey's win is the turning point of musical diversity - so many oriental sounds came after that

5. let's not forget Lordi, who showed you don't have to be pop to win it

6. I wasn't sure what you meant with Euphoria, but yes, it's not something I actively noticed so I believe you she was the first to do so - VERY VERY important nowadays

7. I wouldn't put Jamala or Salvador as the influence really. Since the language rule was removed, only 4 songs out of 25 won in a native langauge, however, for me the turning point in recent years would be ALL the top 5 from 2021 (I know Dađi was in English, but he did all by himself w/ his wife).

The contest in Western Europe was considered gay, long before Dana international. I mean, ABBA won in the seventies! Gay friendly Eurovision diva’s were a thing practically since the very first contest. The fact that Dana international was part of Eurovision, was *because* the contest was already considered extremely gay in 1998.

I also don’t think Eurovision became bigger in gay culture after her win. No offense to Dana, but Eurovision didn’t make her a gay icon outside of Eurovision, like Nana Mouskouri or Vicky Leandros were.

icyDinosaur,"Possible additions imo:

Sergey Lazarev - You Are The Only One (Russia 2016)

Influence: ""Stage-warping"" props

Arguably Mans did something similar, or you could argue that it only really kicked in two years later with Ingrosso, since Sergey doesn't quite commit to it. But I think there's something special here anyway - this is (one of) the first entries that is using elaborate props to create an effect that exists independent of the stage and replaces it with its own setup, frequently (but not necessarily) using some special effects like too. Sweden are particularly fond of this (Ingrosso, Loreen v2, this year), but we've also had it with Snap, this year with the UK, etc.

Lena - Satellite (Germany 2010)

Influence: The ""personal"" staging

This existed through the 2000s but wasn't really all that effective - the rise of more modern pop music through the 1990s and 2000s was accompanied by massive, elaborate performances with excessive dance routines. Dima Bilan's win in 2008 is probably the high point of that with the presence of Plushchenko, but even Molitva, the most personal winner of the decade, has its background singers perform a quite notable choreography. Lena has background singers, but they are basically outside the lighting, don't really dance, and the camera is primarily interacting with her in ways that were completely absent from previous winners/high finishers.",l7dnoz6,1717685042.0,2024-06-07T00:44:02,t3_1d9gr5b,t3_1d9gr5b,"['l7dpxoy', 'l7dnq2s']",2

Again, I think this might be a cultural difference between the former eastern and western block. Just look at what campy western bands were popular in the Soviet Union. I guess because those tame songs were the only western music allowed. 

For teenagers in the USSR, western groups like ABBA, Teach in and Dschingis Khan probably felt radical by the fact they were western, but in Western Europe it was the kind of shallow pop that was mocked in the 70s-90s and only the gays openly loved.

PoetryAnnual74,"I wouldn’t say it was a definitive turning point that one specific year but for many years before the NQ of 2010 melodifestivalen was tweaking primarily its voting system to be able to pick better songs.

Sweden had a period of doing very poorly in Eurovision so it was tested a lot with different voting systems. I remember in 2008 for example when charlotte perelli won it has won the local juries we had then but lost the televote. A famous hated industry person bashed that choice later in one of Swedens largest newspapers after we did poorly in Eurovision saying they the televote winner (sanna Nielsen - empty room) would’ve done better in Eurovision. A lot of Swedes were annoyed we did so bad every year and really didn’t want the local juries anymore. If I recall correctly the international jury was added a few years before 2011 but we kept the national jury as well, but 2011 was the first year the national jury was removed and it was only international jury and televote.

So there was lots of things like that which eventually removed the local Swedish jury and changed it to the international jury and made other tweaks until we won with Loreen and then stuck with that system mostly",l5zs7e8,1716880397.0,2024-05-28T17:13:17,t3_1d2d05p,t3_1d2d05p,"['l5zwm9x', 'l63c5ea', 'l65j1cq']",3

Melodifestivalen, despite Christer Björkman's attempts to modernize it, always seemed like something for a somewhat older audience at the time, and you could see that with how well classic, outdated, schlager style songs would do in comparison to actual modern songs (E-Type 2004 is a good example). 

The Ark managed to win despite that, which probably had a lot to do with the hug fanbase they had, they were basically the biggest band in Sweden at the time, but even they went with a more ""schlager""-influenced song rather than how they usually sound.

They had phenomenal hosts. 

The stage was absolutely gorgeous, and acts used it creatively. 

The northern lights were a good theme, which looked great on the stage. 

Backround OST was good. (Not that anyone cares) 

Postcards were good and managed to cut costs slightly.

Interval acts were good, aside from the very forced ABBA, but let's not act like they weren't basically obliged to do it. A bunch of casuals watch the Grand final, so you can't put something only for the fans there. And even then, they added the band, starting with a joke.

Other than that, both semifinals had interval acts, which were phenomenal for a semifinal. 

Loreen's act was weird, but it's Loreen. When she has a vision in her head, she'll do it. It doesn't remove that her vocals were perfection for the pose. 

SVT (and big credit to the Swedish police) kept violence away in such a contest.

Winning the contest is almost unacceptable; look at the vitriol for Loreen or the dismissive attitude to Kalush Orchestra.

ConfusingConfection,"Stefania (Ukraine 2022). Incredibly creative song, and a risky entry for them not knowing the extent of public sympathy. Such a nice blend of genres and insanely catchy. It gets a bad rap for being the pity winner, but that distracts from the stellar quality of the song. And I don't think Ukraine would've won on some of their other candidates that year (a couple of which truly sucked), obviously they get some pity but they got into the T5 on their own merit, which brings them on par with The Code this year. SOOO glad they didn't cop out and enter a song about how sad war is and shit as some people wanted them to (Switzerland did that for them with their sadboi anthem of 2023).",l47mkf8,1715805724.0,2024-05-16T06:42:04,t3_1csiem7,t3_1csiem7,"['l47mmnq', 'l47mu0e']",2

ConfusingConfection,"Will be interesting to see if Switzerland can stay relevant after this semi - they've dropped off quite a bit and there's been virtually no hype/discussion surrounding them these past few days from what I can tell. Either they come back strong and win or almost win in the final or they fizzle out completely.

My hot take for SF2 is that Eden (Israel) will be well received. The song itself is pretty strong, a lot of casual viewers won't even know the context, and people who do know aren't necessarily that invested and/or aren't necessarily anti-Israel. She also might get a pity vote. That leaves a pretty small subset of people who care enough to actively avoid giving her votes. She also has an opportunity to make an impression on those who haven't even listened to her song but have listened to some/all of the others. In that brief shot last night there was no booing either.

With that said, I'd probably say **Ireland, United Kingdom and Portugal** would be my picks, all countries who have nailed the staging and performance. Notably both Ireland the UK are in my personal bottom 5 this year and Portugal is mid table so I don't think I'm being biased there! **Sweden** also looks great to me and is going to do well. And **Croatia** would probably round out a top 5 for me if we'd been able to see more than 20 seconds of his performance!

Countries I was impressed by but still had flaws were:

* **Ukraine:** Some phenomenal visuals and excellent moments but felt surprisingly empty on stage at times and Jerry was weak vocally.
* **Lithuania:** Actually can't name a flaw but it's very much just the same finished package as in the NF.
* **Moldova:** A lot prettier than I was expecting, even if still way too static and unexciting.
* **Australia:** As I wrote, I think they're owning the stage for the first two minutes and making clever use of a clearly very limited budget. It was the final minute where it started going off the rails a bit with Zaachariaha out of time and their vocal gymnastics a bit wayward. Tighten that and I still think Australia could qualify.
* **Luxembourg:** Still a bit too dark, still don't enjoy the revamp changes very much, but it's an effective performance on the whole and Tali is much improved from the NF.",l2um87r,1715013065.0,2024-05-07T02:31:05,t3_1clivqy,t1_l2uj97j,"['l2uwdwk', 'l2uwzcr']",2

CaptainAnaAmari,"Manizha didn't qualify 😭 But I'm glad that she was 9th here and closest to qualifying. Not mad either that Joost got the wildcard spot instead of her, considering Europapa is my favorite of this year and would've placed high up in this ranking on the whole!

I also kept up with this to check up on some stats. Two countries have 3 entries in the final, that being Italy and, thanks to Europapa getting the wildcard slot, Netherlands. Norway, France, Iceland, Austria, Ukraine and Switzerland have two each, while Belgium, Croatia, Serbia, Finland, Latvia, Sweden and Spain all have one each.

As for years, it looks like this:

&#x200B;

|2013|0|

|2014|1|
|2015|1|
|2016|0|

|2019|4|
|2020|3|
|2021|4|
|2022|5|
|2023|3|
|2024|4|

There's a strong obvious split between 2013-2018 and 2019-2024, cleanly splitting the years in half, with 2022 being our favorite year with 5 whole entries in the final.

Other fun facts:

* Latvia 2023 is the only actual NQ that landed in our final
* 100% of the Austrian, Croatian, Serbian and Spanish entries that got to the semi final qualified. Austria is the only one with two entries, the others only had one

Switzerland depends a lot on the staging, but they’ve had good stage shows every year since their glow up in 2019 so I’m not too worried about it being a total mess. I’m more worried about whether Nemo’s fashion will be off putting to a wider audience. 

Belgium is giving jury darling and televote flop to me right now, I think it will qualify but I think they will miss out on top ten this year.

Wasabismylife,"I agree with most of what you wrote, I feel less strongly about Belgium tho.

My hot take is that, as other comments have pointed out, people are underestimating Greece. Yes it's divisive in the sense that it doesn't appeal to northern europeans (not just Scandinavia, i mean the more northern part of Europe, including for example UK and Netherlands, i don't know if there is a better descriptor, feel free to let me know) based on what I noticed in the comments, but I think it will get a lot of support in the southern/balkan countries (also based on comments). Also it has a very summery vibe and Eurovision is in May, it might sound silly but I think it does work in its favour.

It's a bit difficult to predict with certainty how it will do mainly because we haven't seen a completely live performance, which i don't mind because it's kinda nice to have a surprise to look forward to for the actual show. I'm optimistic about it, and very curious to see how it will go down eventually.",kzszgi0,1713258637.0,2024-04-16T19:10:37,t3_1c59cts,t3_1c59cts,"['kzt2bwn', 'kzvowcy', 'kzt2hv5', 'kzydluk']",4

Wasabismylife,">Why would there be bias against italian women speficially? That makes no sense haha

It doesn't lol but I think op is referring to the fact that the only two women we sent in the last 10 years finished outside of the top 10, but the reason is much less nefarious, the fact is that they were not Sanremo winners but internally selected and in particular Emma's song was just kinda bad (sorry) and Francesca was very nervous and the staging wasn't the best, also she changed the song to be partially in English and I think it didn't work so well.

>Also I don’t see people get angry from Ukraine winning and if they do thats just offensive, the country has been sending quality songs every year the sympathie vote narrative is just annoying to me by now

I couldn't agree more, but unfortunately I think the backlash is definitely going to happen. People are already being dismissive of the song, I often see the take that people like Ukraine just out of sympathy, which I find pretty arrogant to say because I think it's a wonderful song, much better than what they sent last year, and personally I like it even more than Stefania. 

In general I find a lot of stuff people say about Ukraine kinda offensive since their win in 2022 but I feel like I am in the minority because that seems to be the commonly accepted narrative here and in the fandom in general.",kzssldu,1713253382.0,2024-04-16T17:43:02,t3_1c59cts,t1_kzsrw1n,"['kzsvrgi', 'kzsw8uh', 'kzsw1qf']",3

Latvia and Serbia are both quite slow, I think they can both be quite ""hit or miss"".

catlxdy,"Let's go!! It is really a fun thing to do. It makes you think about the songs in a different way while still staying true to your tastes and ranking them according to what you feel. Let me know when you finish your ranking because I'd love to read it! 🥰

And yes, definitely. I was thinking that this year my ""mission"" when it comes to voting will be getting my favorites (especially the ones who are struggling a bit more with the odds) out of the semis! Looking at my list of what I like most, I can already hear my wallet crying faintly. 😆 And that does include Dons, yes! Let's keep our fingers crossed for him!!

MTheBassman,"I appreciate the compliment! I think metal in general can be a lot to process for listeners, so if you can get past that you kinda start to notice more subtle things in music in general because metal songs can be very layered with different motives and ideas. Maybe that's where you got your impression of our kind of people ;) 

But the different opinions in ESC fans are imo the most interesting besides the songs themselves. Music is so subjective that you can always learn to see a song from a different angle if you're open to second opinions.",kzvap2n,1713292784.0,2024-04-17T04:39:44,t3_1c4v74y,t1_kzv6019,[],0

Basically instead of 37., 36.  etc all entries get 1. in front of them (sorry no idea how to upload pictures here)

Not sure what the ""proper"" fix is, but adding a slash before the dot seems to work for me, like

    37\. Iceland 🇮🇸 Hera Bjork - Scared of Heights

which should display as

37. Iceland 🇮🇸 Hera Bjork - Scared of Heights

But Turin in general is dear to me, it's a lovable chaos. The stage was huge and it made everything feel big, like every perfomance was a small concert. The lights, when they worked, really gave us some stunning moments I feel we wouldn't have gotten any other year (it's the freaking sun, it shines in every direction). I feel like LEDs overshadow the artists way too often. Class of 2022 having to make do with only lights and fragments of the screen really let their creativity (or lack of it) shine.  The water was a nice touch and trees and bushes were cute.

SkyGinge,"Good to see someone enjoying Throwback Thursday, and I definitely think there is room to do more there. We do have quite a few projects we're working on at the moment on top of trying to make general improvements to the sub/moderation so I'm not sure we as mods can commit to helping organise it. That's ok though because we don't want to centralise everything cool and exciting so that it's being done by mods - this community is everybody's! I did my prediction games here for three years before I became a mod and if there is enough interest the community will still show up.

You seem aware of some of the practical hurdles and also probably have some ideas already of what contests you might want to watch. We use synctube for watch-alongs together as a mod team, though that does have a capacity like Emu said.

A couple of thoughts - don't take them as gospel as I'm spit-balling a bit here:

* If you maybe take this week to plan, that'd leave four weeks until rehearsals start and that takes over the sub. That'd mean four watch-alongs if you want to make it a weekly thing.
* You can make a de-facto 'live thread' by making comments sort by new as the suggested filter.
* Do note that the older the ESC you go for, the less people it will appeal to as a general (judging from previous projects that people have tried).
* Watchalongs during the off-season (June-December) seem like a particularly good idea to me, maybe as a monthly thing. The community is much smaller and tighter-knit at that time and you'd probably get more personal interactions in live-chat and also potentially overcome some of the practical concerns since numbers will be lower.

Happy to discuss ideas further in modmail if you want - as you may have gathered I do like getting new community projects off the ground (i.e. the Throwback Thursday Supervote!) and I'm happy to discuss practicalities even if I can't personally commit to helping out much!",kwinq61,1711388903.0,2024-03-26T03:48:23,t3_1bnhmsc,t3_1bnhmsc,[],0

PenglingPengwing,"Hatari❤️ -  Iceland 2019

I saw them live 2 years ago and it was probably the best show I’ve ever seen. Definitely one that was the most aesthetically pleasing and artistic. Also despite their stage performance and most of their public press interaction when in Hatari form, once out of Hatari personas, they are incredibly sweet and nice people. And Einar talks a lot! :D

Back in the day I loved Lordi - Finland 2006 (also saw them live a couple years back), last year Australia 2023 and Germany 2023 were both very cool. (Once they tour Europe, I’d love to see them live).

Also, I’d argue that Jezebel by The Rasmus - Finland 2022 belongs to this category too. Especially if we included Kabat - Czechia 2007 here. Tho I did not enjoy Jezebel, it was flop by The Rasmus usual standards. Kabat was alright but I’m kinda biased as there’s a lot of prejudice when it comes to listening to Kabat here in Czechia.",kveze50,1710763923.0,2024-03-18T22:12:03,t3_1bhmkbs,t3_1bhmkbs,['kvezeqp'],1

Videos from the preparties also help to scratch the itch of seeing the contestants interact (which we got a *lot* of wholesome content from last year) whilst also helping us to figure out how people are going to perform vocally in may.

TimeG37,"Not always. Denmark 2014, Ukraine 2023 and Germany 2011 are good examples of songs that were both good and did pretty well. Of course this has become more uncommon since 2015. Since that year only 3 host entries (Sweden 2016, Italy 2022 and Ukraine 2023) have come outside of the bottom 5. This streak of host entry flops is gradually coming to an end, but it's true that many broadcasters make a weaker NF so they make sure that they not win again.

In regards to Sweden, I agree that Frans winning Mello in 2016 (although his song wasn't terrible) against much better entries was a complete war crime, but that happened mainly due to his popularity at the time.

While M&M winning this year's Mello was also in big part thanks to their popularity, I think there is one big difference between the two and that's their competition.

Frans won against an absolutely unbelievable Mello line-up (Oscar Zia, Lisa Ajax, Wiktoria, Robin Bengtsson to name a few, all of them with amazing entries) just because of his popularity.

On the other hand M&M have won against a very weak line-up (everyone except Maria had a worse song than their previous attempts), so in their case their victory was more similar to Benjamin Ingrosso's (who won in 2018 against imo the worst Mello line-up to date) where they were one of the best entries of a very weak line-up, and their popularity simply made their victory guaranteed. I also thought they weren't the best this year but they were easily one of the better ones and they definitely had the most polished performance and staging.

Also I think Unforgettable is a much better entry than If I Were Sorry. It's just as bland, but it's better performed and much better staged. It's not as radio-friendly but that isn't really a problem at ESC.",ku8hzvi,1710087423.0,2024-03-11T02:17:03,t3_1bbdcgc,t3_1bbdcgc,[],0

One sings in a clear polished performance, the other kind of shouts out the song in anger yet the clash of personalities in the song work perfectly together. A song about hatred winning. Some people linked it to Gaza conflict as the band drew out a Palestinian flag during voting

Croatia - 2017 (My friend). Nothing unussual in lyrics except the man singing as if he has two voices inside of him

Israel - 2007 (Push the button). Very odd about nuclear or missile threat. (Please if someone can help explain the meaning to me and why Iran apparently was so against this song. To me part of the lyrics felt like pro-peace song but was it actually at least partially pro war?

Interval act - 2019 Madonna (Quavo). Arguably the weirdest theme of all. Center of many conspiracy theories.

Just so you know, I grew up a mix of classical music enjoyer (mainly baroque) as well as a metal head (started with Black Sabbath, went into Deep Purple and Rainbow, then dived head on into Iron Maiden and Judas Priest); later in life I toned down a bit and became a rabid Beattlemaniac, and for more modern tastes my current favorite band is Radiohead but my favorite song of the current century is No One Knows by QoTSA. But I listen to pretty much anything and enjoy so many different things (my favorite entries for UMK were Sini and Sara, for instance, but I was happy W95 won because he ate; but I digress, sorry).

Your voice sounded quite appropriate for that single, and your guitar BLASTS! I really enjoyed it, I kid you not. Even though Guns and Roses is not among my favorites (I have some reserves to Axel), I like and respect Slash quite a lot because he was the one non poser in that band (I went to see his SnakePit on the ""5 o'Clock tour"" in the 90s - it was amazing).

HaziAgat,"(i'm gonna edit this reply later to actually have my detailed opinions but I'm in a hurry rn, just know for now that this is a cool year and the Dutch entry is really bad bye)

Edit: Okay here we are! This was a really good year, probably my favorite of the 2010s. Every entry is really good, or at least has some redeeming quality (harder to find with some than others...) so it's just a really pleasant experience to watch. 1944 is probably one of my favorite winners too. There's also Romania, and it sucks they didn't get to participate (i would've had them 25th, which isn't too bad in a year this fun).

Wait...Romania announced to be not participating late, held in Sweden, country returns after leaves of absences (Bosnia, Bulgaria...Luxembourg), there are some parallels to 2024 here. Cool. (also wow, Bulgaria came back in style.)

SkyGinge,"2016 is a weird old year for me. Presentation-wise, I think this is the best the contest has ever been - Mans and Petra are a ridiculously good hosting duo, and the skits and bits are consistently excellent. Looking back eight years later though, I find the song selection not as amazing as I once thought - it's still overall pretty strong, but I do struggle for favourites towards the bottom of my top 10. I have also always loved this stage, but in retrospect I think it's way too dark for a lot of the performances.

This was the first year that my overall favourite actually ended up winning, which was a pretty amazing feeling, especially as I didn't think much of Russia or Australia's songs. *1944* is such a cool song - atmospheric, cleverly composed, emotional and bolstered by Jamala's vocal excellent. The scream note at the end is one of my favourite musical moments in ESC history. Bulgaria's 'redemption arc' was also really heartwarming, seeing a country whose entries consistently placed in my top 10 over the years they failed to qualify finally have the ESC success they deserved.",kpgxaqu,1707391265.0,2024-02-08T21:21:05,t3_1alt78f,t1_kpgwvzf,"['kph6yso', 'kphatd2']",2

I think the biggest issue is that on their own, most entries are fine, but it doesn't feel like a whole package? It just feels like lots of random entries shoved together, hence the balladiness, if that's a word. And don't get me started on the fake cheer sounds. The building bridges slogan was cool though.

SkyGinge,"2015 is a contest I have very conflicted feelings about. The prevailing feeling the contest left me with was disappointment - the hosts were wooden, the stage underwhelming and the camerawork generally poor. The canned, artificial applause killed the sense of the crowd adding to entries. And the final result, with another Swedish victory so soon after 2012 and fan-favourites like Spain and Slovenia finishing absolutely nowhere, left a very bitter taste in my mouth.

Song-wise, this is a contest of highs and lows. I'm surprised this sub which usually doesn't like ballads is so positive about this particular contest when the final, much like 2022, suffers from having way too many ballads in the second half. Almost every non-qualifier is pretty awful either in composition or performance (why Macedonia whyyy). However, the top 9 finishers are really excellent and there are several other songs among the qualifiers which I absolutely love. Belgium 2015 is one of my favourite performances ever, Sweden's graphics are just ridiculously well polished, and my top three here is probably one of my favourite top 3s ever, maybe only beaten by 2018.",kof5loo,1706786442.0,2024-02-01T21:20:42,t3_1ag8ovn,t1_kof5i8n,['kof5m7x'],1

Lie to Me - Agree, very overrated. Kinda odd but it's my least favorite song Czechia sent in the past 5 years (yes, including Omaga, I'm weird)

Arcade - Not my personal favorite/no.1 pick of that year, but it's a deserving winner

Spirit In The Sky - Disagree, it's amazing, and it deserves its placement

Soldi - Actually agree, back in 2019 I used to dislike this a lot more. Now it has grown on me, but still I don't think it deserved finishing second.

Amar Pelos Dois - Yes! Someone finally said it! It's one of my least favorite winners of the 21st centuries, and it sure didn't deserve it. I just...don't like this! (yup, downvotes incoming)

River - No. I mean I do agree that it didn't deserve 12th place, but I think it should've finished *higher*, not lower.

Jezebel - Again, no. I actually think this is underrated

SloMo - This is a gray area for me

Dance You Off - Absolutely agree, I don't think I need to elaborate 

Non Mi Avete Fatto Niente - No. Just No. Disagree

Zitti e Bouni - Disagree, deserving winner

Hatrid Mun Sigra - Don't listen to this kind of Eurovision songs often, so this is a gray area as well

Telemóveis - Agreed, overrated. I don't get why some people think this is golden, I personally think it deserved its NQ

Now for your 'underrated' picks:

Walking Out - Agreed

Grab the Moment - Absolutely agreed, one of my favorites of 2017. I actually didn't pay much attention to it back in 2017, but now I love this so much. But hey, it did finish high though!

Heroes - A great winner, and agreed. While I do think Belgium should've won, it definitely needs to get talked about more.

Like It - another gray area for me

Sister & Hvala Ne - Disagree, I really don't like these entries, and they didn't deserve a better result

Storm - Agreed

Fade to Black - I don't really like ballads, but he was impressive! His vocals, just...wow

Circles - I disagree, but it's oddly catchy. 

Voices - It's a nice song, but at this point I think Sweden needed a result like this to start being more ""creative"" with their entries (I mean 2022 and 2023 are an improvement imo)

If you're using Italy and Sanremo as an example you *absolutely* can deny that. The priority for Italians is Sanremo, not Eurovision, and Italian fans are constantly reminding people that it's not a national selection.

AspaAllt,"I can't speak for Italy and Sanremo, but I can speak for Sweden and Melodifestivalen, and in this case I'm pretty sure they've got something in common.

In Sweden, Melodifestivalen is the biggest tv program. Unless the Sweden would reach an unlikely high stage in football, or meet Finland in a hockey final, Melodifestivalen gets the highest viewing figures of any program all year (apart from the yearly Disney's From us all to you all on Christmas eve, but nothing can come slose to that). 

So? Well, when poles complained that, if memeory serves me right, Blanka only got 6 000 votes compared to Janns 18 000, the final of Melodifestivalen had 937 thousand voters. That's nearly 9 percent OF THE COUNTRY. 

My point is that Melodifestivalen and Sanremo is MAINSTREAM. In their respective countries, they are the big shows, and winning those are the goal, and going to Eurovision is just a bonus. Nobody cares that the gender of the winner is the same, on the contrary, very polished pop songs by stylish men just happen to work really well for the wine-aunts popping open their weekly treat of Estrella Sourcream and onion chips on the saturday evening after a hard week of whatever middleclass lower middle aged women work with.

Scholastico,">The priority for Italians is Sanremo, not Eurovision, and Italian fans are constantly reminding people that it's not a national selection.

People often forget that Sanremo started ***before*** Eurovision and ***was the inspiration*** for Eurovision.

And before that it's almost one year we send a woman and the other we send a guy.

If there's a bias it's probably in the internal selection, but it's a bit complicated. The last time we had a national final was in 2017 where the artist, Demy, was already chosen by ERT. Since then, every single artist from 2018 to 2023 was unknown to Greeks (Marina Satti in 2024 is the first time since 2017 where we send an artist who has some success, I'd argue she's a bigger name than Demy was in 2017). I don't think there is actually a bias tho because most male artists here either don't fit in ESC (their music style and genre, most are either in rap/trap or laiko) or are not interested (Satti for example, after declining twice to represent Greece, had said she wanted to participate in the future, so choosing her is the logical decision.

“In the warm night 
A night full of dreams
Happiness lasts forever

Her beautiful face

They represented Sweden and Norway at Eurovision. Belarus and Morocco don't own people of Belarusian and Amazigh heritage.

- Robin Bengtsson was a guest on Swedish Drag race the first season, and got a fabulous drag makeover. His drag name is Stareena Thunderpussy. 

-The song “The worrying kind” was written by Ola Salo, singer of The Ark, and is about his diagnosed OCD. He was very ill when he wrote the song but he has gotten much healthier since. 

-Malena Ernman is the mother of Greta Thunberg. Due to respecting her daughters mission she is vegan and has sworn of traveling by airplane for the rest of her life. 

-Frans big breakthrough was as a 7 year old boy, when he sung a chill, happy reggae song about Zlatan Ibrahimović. 

-John Lundquist is the Swedish dubb voice of Simba in the 2019 Lion King remake, as well as Michael Jordan in “Space Jam: A New Legacy”.

RS3_PT,"So, my rank, as I’ve been watching all Eurovisions since 2005 recently:

16. Eric Saade - Popular (2011): I don’t think this song has any redeeming quality besides the live performance. The lyrics get cringier and melody gets cheesier as the years pass, and I don’t think it’s ever gonna be fashionable again.

15. Frans - If I Were Sorry (2016): I really don’t like it. I don’t like his voice or the style of the song. I can’t wrap my head around how it got 5th place.

14. Tusse - Voices (2021): While I don’t dislike it, I think it lacks the punch and polish that Swedish entries usually have. 

13. Robin Stjemberg - You (2013): It was the only song I had to listen again to remember it. It’s pleasant but not very memorable.

12. The Ark - The Worrying Kind (2007): I have a tendency to like rock more than any other genre, and even though I don’t dislike it, it’s lacking some grit. It sound like budget David Lee Roth.

11. Anna Bergendahl - This Is My Life (2010): It should have qualified. It’s a pleasant ballad in a year with not too many great songs.

10. Charlotte Perrelli - Hero (2008): It’s a decent europop song, which was the go to genre in most of the 2000s contests.

9. Benjamin Ingrosso - Dance You Off (2018): It’s just cute and catchy, but it’s not strong enough to stand out. It needed to pop out more.

8. Robin Bengtsson - I Can't Go On (2017): It’s a generic catchy pop song, but the performance was good, even though Robin isn’t great at giving face. But the dancers and treadmills made up for that.

7. Loreen - Tattoo (2023) - I wanted to like it better, but it does sound repetitive and has no innovative factor. She’s a great performer, but the song still is a disappointment. That said, it still is a better song than most of these Swedish entries.

6. Malena Emman - La Voix (2009) - Though it’s not my cup of tea, I think it’s a very well done song for it’s time and genre, so it deserves a good placement.

5. John Lundvik - Too Late For Love (2019) - It’s a great pop song, and his singing abilities are great. It was a great performance. For me personally, it feels a bit too clean and overproduced.

4. Sanna Nielsen - Undo (2014) - A great ballad that stood out in a year that was clearly Conchita’s. It’s the first Swedish song that’s top 10 material in my Scoreboard.

The Top 3 are all great songs to me, and it really just  down to personal taste.

3. Måns Zelmerlöw - Heroes (2015) - An immaculately produced pop song, and Måns is a great performer.

2. Loreen - Euphoria (2012) - She really started an era with this one.

1. Cornelia Jakobs - Hold Me Closer (2022) - The way she emoted on stage sold the song to me. It’s one of my top songs of 2022, including not Eurovision songs.",judlcmy,1690915015.0,2023-08-02T04:36:55,t3_15faoti,t3_15faoti,"['judmpm5', 'judna6o', 'judp5av', 'judqtsw', 'judr8sg']",5

I wish there was more enthusiasm about the German NF within the German population and music industry itself and you could see a bit of it this year with more established acts competing and significantly more fans being interested in the show.

I currently just want NDR to work on the format we've had this year, perfecting it, maybe not hide it in a late night slot and get a studio that fits more than 400 people.

None,"Concerning 2023, there is exactly one reason LotL did as bad as they did:

Catastrophically bad show, including castrophically bad sound mixing.  
Seriously, a staging like this with a song like that would barely work in an actual metal concert. On the ESC stage, having such a boring show that's basically just ""an excerpt from a metal concert"" is borderline unforgivable.  
You could see with Australia how much better it COULD be done.

Also, the sound mixing was just absolutely terrible. Everything - melody, instruments, voices - was bleeding together, which - again - would've been ""okay"" during an actual metal concert, but on the ESC stage, it's just beyond comprehension what they were thinking.  
And again, you could see with Australia how much better it COULD have been - every instrument, the vocals, the solos, etc. was crystal clear.

He was sick before the final though despite before that stating trying everything to avoid exactly that. It's so easy but so difficult at the same time. We just need a great, cohesive, non-lackluster performance. If I shortly go back to B&G people were saying after the rehearsals that the last % that it needs were missing.

NICK3805,"Eaea certainly isn't for everyone, but it's certainly well made artistically. It's a song honoring the strengh and dedication of one's female ancestors, particulary Blanca Paloma's Grandmother who introduced her to Flamenco. 

As the song belongs into the New Flamenco Genre, the sound and meaning are closely tied together and so is the staging: The hands probably symbolise motherly care and conforting while the while backround and circle might be a reference to the line ""Mi niño, cuando me muera/ Que me entierren en la luna/ Y to’as las noches te vea"" (engl.: ""My child, when I die/May they bury me in the Moon/ So that I’ll see you every night"") and that are just a few of the many great references and meanings of the entry. There is a lot more.

jimijoop,"In Greece is literally the opposite.
The 2000s are seen as ""The Golden Age""  and ""The time where Eurovision peaked"" because back then we were successful during that period and the interest about the contest peaked in that decade. The whole country was obsessed with Eurovision and the Greek entry back then. Plus a lot of ESC songs were hits here.

On the contrary the 2010s are seen as ""The Dark age"" not only due to our poor results but also because the interest about the contest  was decreased due to economic crisis and Eurovision is seen less seriously by the Greek media & people compared to the 00s. I remember a lot of comments on the Greek social media such as ""Eurovision is all about politics nowadays"", ""Juries ruined the contest"", ""Who cares about Eurovision?"", ""Full of crap songs"", ""waste of money"" etc. It seems a large portion of the Greek public just pretends 2010s ESC never happened outside of Fuego, Euphoria and Alcohol is Free.

And the diaspora singers we sent over the last years did more harm than good despite we got 2 TOP10 results with them as the Greek media and public basically stopped caring for the Greek entry in favor for Cyprus or other countries entries. You know things are bad when the Italian entry gets more praise by the Greek media than the Greek entry in the last few years. Such thing would've been unthinkable a decade ago.

I really hope ERT will get their shit together and finally take the contest seriously next year. They really killed the interest here with their actions. If there wasn't Cyprus we would've been like Romania now where the public interest is basically nonexistent.

euroboy123,"1956-1964 - the classic era - this was when eurovision was in it's early days, it did have some hits from time to time but it was just a contest that unified the continent.

1965-1976 - the golden era - when some of the biggest names appeared at eurovision and the songs were their biggest.

1977-1986 - the variety era - when more genres were appearing at eurovision making the contest more diverse

1987-1997 - the ballad era - where the majority of entries were all ballads, 1997 was the closest classic contest to modern eurovision.

1998-2008 - the dark era / crezjavision (get the joke?) - when televoting was introduced and semi final were added, eurovision went mad with a lot of joke entries and also saw the rise of Eastern Europe to eurovision dominance, 1998 was the first time the general public were allowed to attend, the orchestra and the language rule was gone by 1999 with 2000 being considered the first modern eurovision, the semi finals were introduced in 2004 allowing for all the countries that wanted to do eurovision to actually appear in eurovision.

2009-2017 - the generic era - when each entry had no effect on worldwide charts (except Sweden 2012 (so the bot can tell us))

2018-present - the TikTok era - when eurovision entries started going Tiktok viral like Arcade, Maneskin and Snap with 2023 being the peak of the TikTok Era, Also Ukraine winning during a war would further add attention to the contest",jtrutnc,1690527742.0,2023-07-28T17:02:22,t3_15b9pf3,t3_15b9pf3,"['jts2pas', 'jtsvawm', 'jtruu3x', 'jtsvbco']",4

PortableAfternoon,"2001-2008 definitely wasn’t a golden age in terms of music quality. Perhaps it was in terms of modernising the contest, expanding to new countries and adding the semi finals, but not in terms of the music. I can only speak for the UK, but I imagine it was the same in a lot of the other “traditional” Eurovision countries, but I don’t think the contest had had a worse reputation than it did in the 2000s.

As far as the media and general public in the “traditional” countries were concerned, it had become more of a circus than a song contest, dominated by novelty acts, low quality pop music and bloc voting from the East. The music didn’t sound much like what was on the radio at the time and the winner wasn’t guaranteed Europe-wide chart success.

Many of us old enough to remember that era shudder at the suggestions of returning to 100% televote. I think the contest would look a lot different today if it weren’t for the 50/50 system.",jtq2uu7,1690495506.0,2023-07-28T08:05:06,t3_15b9pf3,t3_15b9pf3,[],0
NICK3805,"I can only speak for Germany, but here definitively not. A lot of fans were already disheartened by the bad results of the past years (through those are commonly viewed as deserved, the frustration is mainly aimed at the NDR for poorly managing the whole thing) and now again coming in dead last when we had a decent song that was well-received by both international ESC fans as well as the German General Public was another huge letdown, especially when it needed a petition with more than 100.000 signatures to force NDR to abandon it's ""radio-friendly""-formular. We are currently running at risk that the NDR will revert back to the ""Radio-Friendly""-Formular of the last years thanks to the lack of votes from other countries. Many long-time ESC fans view it as ""Europe having let us down"". 

There is a not so insignificant portion of ESC fans who want us to drop out and this movement is also supported by Guildo Horn (Germany 1998). Another good chunk wants us to drop out of the Big5, but to still compete. 

Outside of the ESC Bubble, the contest also struggles to make an impact as the time when there were only Jury Votings has led to the stigma that the ESC is ""Old People's Music"". At least in Germany, that time actually harmed the reputation of the ESC more than the 2000s when it was Televotes only. 

PS: The Finnish Jury gave Lord of The Lost 12 Points in the Pre-Selection. I have a bit of a personal problem with Finnish Juries currently.

There's so much variety now in song selections, and countries are definitely making their best efforts to put actual quality performances, even in silly ones.

The 1990s on their own were interesting because it was probably a point at which the contest was expanding due to the changing map of Europe, yet the contest was probably at its least relevant musically. You could also see a rapid change in the technology used, with the introduction of things like spokespersons awarding their points on camera by satellite link rather than over the phone for the first time in 1994, the over the top visual effects and blue room scoreboard in 1996 and the televoting test in 1997.

kir_ye,"> the Albina's curse

Which was a one-time thing and won't be replicated in the foreseeable future due to the voting changes.

> Very well in the SF; a bad result in the GF

It's mostly not about Australia per se. It's an Australian thing that there's no diaspora/neighboring boost.

It's an overlapping of few separate effects:

• the difference between SF/GF voting dynamics and voter's motivation

• the lack of balance between two semi-finals (especially in 2018, 2019, and 2023 when Australia was allocated in weaker semis and scored decently)

• the running order change between SF and GF (that influences televoting but barely influences jury scores)

• low unconditional televoting boost

> or the opposite

The opposite is definitely not the case of Australia. Belgium 2023 and Estonia 2023 benefited from the GF juries; Sweden 2021 and Israel 2018 went from performing weaker and earlier in their semis to delivering late in the running order and scoring higher",jqwv6dk,1688663436.0,2023-07-07T03:10:36,t3_14sejzk,t3_14sejzk,['jqwvsro'],1

alexspyforever," Since the early days of Eurovision, Sweden have dominated. 

Well Sweden has been there since 1958, those were the early days. Interesting how you ignore most of those early days and come to the above conclusion. First win of Sweden was Abba in 1974, their 15th attempt. But let's see how it looks if I split them in 4 time periods:

1958-1975 (16 participations): 5 x Top 5 (1 win, 1 x 2nd)  
1977-1992 (16 participations): 6 x top 5 (2 wins, 2 x 3rd  
1993-2008 (16 participations): 7 x top 5 (1 win, 2 x 3rd)  
2009-2023 (14 participations): 9 x top 5 (3 wins, 2 x 3rd)

My conclusion would be the clear dominance was in the last period especially from 2011 until now with 9 x top 5. Until Loreen won first time in 2012 Sweden was still 'only' on 4 wins so behind France, Luxembourg etc. Ireland set the record of 7 wins in 1996 (and after that didn't seem to bother any more), Sweden needed another 30 more contests to equalize that record. So yes in history Sweden has been of the powerhouses since the early 70s but dominance in the last 12 years max.",jpcayaj,1687609625.0,2023-06-24T22:27:05,t3_14hf8nb,t3_14hf8nb,[],0

optimizationphdstud,"Nice writeup)

There is one remark I would like to mention. I may be wrong but I think there is mistake in calculations. Check it out. Sweden's average score in finals in 21 century (since 2000)  is 7.9 or if we add their 1999 winning entry its 7.6 but not 6.75. Also, if we take into account all results in 21 century their average score is 8.69. Both Italy and Ukraine have better average scores with 6.83 and 8.277 respectively. Actually, depending on how we evaluate results, both Ukraine and Italy have ""the best"" average positions in Eurovision history.

Also, adding my 2 cents, while Sweden has had a great music industry I believe they became a true Eurovision powerhouse only in 2010s. While they have sent great singers and had streaks of great/good/above average results before, I wouldn't say that they have dominated the contest since early days considering that in 20th century there were such big powerhouses as France, UK, Ireland and to some extend Italy, Israel, Luxembourg, Germany and the Netherlands.",jpjez4b,1687744481.0,2023-06-26T11:54:41,t3_14hf8nb,t3_14hf8nb,[],0

aidan755,I feel like this system wouldn’t have caused anywhere near as much controversy because the difference between jury and televote isn’t as in your face. Only big fans would bother to look up the split.,jp7i86f,1687518043.0,2023-06-23T21:00:43,t3_14g57co,t3_14g57co,[],0

Squidward759,"The 2010-2012 one is based on points. Jury and the televote basically give points like they do now, but there’s a combined jury/televote vote basically. Country that gets the highest combined points from a country (max. is 24) gets 12 points, then 10, then 8 etc. If there’s a tie between two or more countries, whoever got more televote points wins the tie.

The 2013-2015 one is based on ranks. Jury and televote rank all songs like they do now, and for country X’s combined jury/televote vote, all ranks are combined, and the 10 best ones get the points, again if there’s a tie, better rank in televote wins the tie.

For example, a country that comes 11th in jury and televote of a country will get 0 from that country in the 2010-2012 system, because 11th twice gives you 0 combined points. But in the 2013-2015 system 11th twice gives a combined rank of 22 which actually gives you a decent chance to get a few points. (This actually happened this year, as Poland finished 11th in both the jury and televote of Greece)",jp47b3o,1687454968.0,2023-06-23T03:29:28,t3_14g57co,t1_jp44yow,"['jp4dowj', 'jp4ezjv', 'jp4vh06', 'jp4x6dw', 'jp4xuad', 'jp4y75n', 'jp4yiqt', 'jp55xx4']",8
Tomas-T,"thanks for taking a time and explaning to me. still confused because I'm suck in math LOL

so let me get it:

in the 10-12 system is simply combining the points from juries and televotrs and the 12,10,8-1 points are being given.

and in the 13-15 system we are looking at the placement they end in each set and the 10 with the smallest numbers are the one to get the points? like if Norway was first in both juries and televots in Israelm, it means that the rank is 2, which means Norway will get 12 points from Israel?",jp4dowj,1687457485.0,2023-06-23T04:11:25,t3_14g57co,t1_jp47b3o,"['jp4ezjv', 'jp4vh06', 'jp4x6dw', 'jp4xuad', 'jp4y75n', 'jp4yiqt', 'jp55xx4']",7
Squidward759,"No problem :), and yes that’s exactly what it is!

(Another example is that Finland came first in the San Marino televote, and last in their jury, which means a combined rank of 27, and in that case, meant no points from SM to Finland",jp4ezjv,1687457994.0,2023-06-23T04:19:54,t3_14g57co,t1_jp4dowj,"['jp4vh06', 'jp4x6dw', 'jp4xuad', 'jp4y75n', 'jp4yiqt', 'jp55xx4']",6

so in short, in the 10-12 system you want the score to be the largest while in the 13-15 system you want it to the be smallest",jp4xuad,1687465382.0,2023-06-23T06:23:02,t3_14g57co,t1_jp4x6dw,"['jp4y75n', 'jp4yiqt', 'jp55xx4']",3
