Potential solar panel issue. ,1efu197,12,"Hi all, 
I bought a property in South East Qld last year with solar panels already installed. The panels are supposedly on about 6 or 8 years old, and have been cleaned every other tear.  The previous owner is a bit of a snake oil salesman, so i take what he has told me with a grain of salt.   

I have trees close to the western side if the house, but otherwise the panels are in full sun.  The property is close to a quarry so thete is a fair bit of dust gettings around.  I have been on the roof and looked at the panels and they look a little dusty but not too bad.    

My issue is, they dont seem to be functioning as well as other people's in my area.  Others claim they have barely any charges on their ergon bill, whereas mine is the same as when i lived without  panels.

Is anyone able to give me sine advice on what the oroblem might be or who to contact to priblem solve with?

I have attached a section of my ergon bill ti show the credits for the last quarter, and the inverter label. ",1722347898.0,2024-07-30T23:58:18,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1efu197
Advice for newcomers to Australia?,1e5kktk,33,"Hi all,

Greetings from the UK! Not 100% sure if this is the right forum and I hope I am not breaking any rules :)

My partner and I are thrilled to share that we received our PR 189 just yesterday ‚Äì yay! We live in London and work as a nurse and an HR Advisor. Culturally, we are from Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe. We are planning to move soon to one of Australia's big hubs, wherever we find good job opportunities and like the area.

To that end, we wanted to ask if you could share some tips you wish you knew when you moved to Australia or consider common knowledge as locals but might not be so obvious to us. For instance, tips about finding and applying for jobs, CV formatting, and work culture customs would be incredibly helpful since we won‚Äôt be aware of those as foreigners. Additionally, we would love to hear some ""must know"" insights about cultural and lifestyle shocks we should prepare for, and any general ""get those sorted"" tips such as setting up for tax, Medicare, bank accounts, etc.

We would greatly appreciate any advice that might not be immediately obvious to newcomers and can save us from ""predictable"" stress later down the line.

Thank you so much!


Edit: many thanks to you all lovely folks for helping reassure us with wonderful advice! To answer some questions: we are foreign born respectively from Asia and Eastern Europe, but have lived in the UK for the last 12 years. Moved here to study and work when we were teens. We knew its time to move for better lifestyle and for our future family. We choose Australia after carefully researching all commonwealth countries where we can integrate professionally and culturally. We fell in love with Australia despite my fear of snakes and big spiders (i am prepared mentally üòÖ). Once again thank you all!

Pet insurance for multiple cats,1cgzya2,25,"So I‚Äôve just spent $2,300 on one of my cats to have her damaged tail amputated.  Fortunately I did have the money at this time, but I felt encouraged to look up pet insurance.  The monthly outgoing seemed almost do-able for one cat, but there is no way I could afford to insure all of them.

Does anybody have pet insurance for 7 cats (or a mixture of cats and dogs) and be able to tell me approximately how much it would cost per month?  Admittedly I am asking more from a point of interest because I already know it is not something I could afford, but I did wonder, for example how many months of payments would be the equivalent to what I paid today.

They are all desexed and microchipped but other than that, this one cat in particular has not needed a vet visit since her desexing visit as a kitten and she is now 5 years old.

Out of the 7 of them, this is the third cat that has needed to see the vet other than when they were desexed as kittens.  Our boy Boof spent Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day 2021 at the vets from a snake bite and one other had an injury to her back end that fortunately was just bruising.

EDIT for the perfect people who wanted to judge rather than just give advice on my actual query:

Yeah well the idea of keeping cats inside is relatively new in the big scheme of things.  I am 55 and have had cats since the day I was born.  My past cats lived to ages 17, 18, 14, 13, 17 respectively and were indoor/outdoor cats.  There was no such thing as microchipping when the first two were alive but all others were all desexed and microchipped and had very few vet visits throughout their lifetime.  You may, or may not, be interested to know that when I was a child, cats were primarily outdoor only, were fed only on scraps but were still loved as much as they are today.

My current cats are 5 and 6 years old and have been indoor/outdoor cats until I moved across the road two years ago and since then I have been doing my best to create an indoor life for them.  I was forced to sell my house through no fault of my own which changed the living conditions for all of my family including my cats.  Obviously this was not something I planned for and attempting to force 7 cats to be only indoor cats has been difficult for us all.

For your information - because, you know, your posts were so helpful, I have now spent over $2000 to attach brackets and cat netting to the top of my entire back yard fence but am waiting for the builder to return and build a gate for the driveway that I can also attach the brackets and cat netting.  I am also waiting on the builder to enclose my front yard.  I have already enclosed my back deck and front verandah with cat netting and it works a treat, but I do still let them out at times because they are not used to being indoor cats, the house I now live in is smaller than the one we moved from, and until they can be contained in the yard, I consider it cruel for them to be kept indoors, where they cannot get away from each other.  Also, it is not the easiest of things to train adult cats to use kitty litter or even find enough space to place multiple litter trays.

Obviously if I knew what the future held I would not have taken on as many cats when I did.  You will be pleased to know, no doubt, that once I have a builder who has the time to complete my plans, my cats will have a quarter acre block all enclosed with cat netting, with trees to climb, dirt to poop in, and lots of fun cat walks and nooks up high throughout the house.",1714501676.0,2024-05-01T04:27:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1cgzya2/pet_insurance_for_multiple_cats/
Suppose the next mainline Pok√©mon games had a region based off of Australia. What wildlife would be most deserving of having Pok√©mon based off of them?,1cgwpo4,24,"Ever since Red & Blue, Pok√©mon has used real-life geographical areas as inspiration for its game settings. The most recent iteration, Scarlet & Violet, are set in a region based off of Spain. If there were to be one set in Australia, what creatures would you want to see? There are already a couple of Pok√©mon based off of Australian wildlife that could be given regional variants. Kangaskhan is a large, bulky kangaroo-and-joey, while Komala is a koala-like creature that is always asleep from birth to death. Other existing Pok√©mon that could fit in are:

* Ariados, a poison spider Pokemon
* Finizen and Palafin, dolphin-based Pokemon
* Ekans and Arbok, snake Pokemon
* Bunnelby and Diggersby: common Rabbit Pokemon (I know rabbits are highly invasive pest species in Aus; that's the point of having these. There are rat and mongoose Pokemon in the games set in Hawaii for the same reason).
* Ducklett and Swanna - I think their names speak for themselves
* Tentacool and Tentacruel - poisonous jellyfish Pokemon

Hey Australia!

&#x200B;

I am doing a project that needs shared-consciousness input! I am painting very Australian monsters into historical images. See above.

&#x200B;

So...What, in our society are Australians really afraid of? What are our ""monsters""?

&#x200B;

Starting with the creatures in our backyard, but also extending out into wider society? I want to leverage real creatures, groups or individuals that Australian's find horrifying in one way or another. Be it threatening our existential or biological existence.

&#x200B;

Here is the current list of creatures

&#x200B;

* Cane toads
* Leeches
* Blue ringed octopus
* White Sharks
* Poisonous Snakes
* Big kangaroos
* Funnelwebs
* European Wasps
* Cockroaches
* Ticks

&#x200B;

then there are certain types of people that are (rightly or wrongly) turned into monsters in our minds

&#x200B;

* mining magnates
* real estate agents
* politicians
* immigrants (boat people specifically are vilified)

&#x200B;

And also the Gympy Gympy plant. Nightmarish

&#x200B;

(For clarity I do not consider any of these creatures OR people to be actual monsters, I'm just talking society)

&#x200B;

Thanks u/2happycats and u/cojoco and everyone for your input on another thread that got deleted. Apologies for so many run ups to this post.",1712874904.0,2024-04-12T08:35:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1c1skmf/australian_monsters/

In my experience this isn't true - people either kill all snakes because too close to house/camp or pets regardless of species, or leave them all alone when further away. Also Red Bellied black bite = lose a limb so they are considered \*\*very\*\* dangerouse even if not deadly. Maybe this is misinformation/need to downvote?

"Trip report: 3-week food, wine, and adventure itinerary",17ylf4i,11,"G'day friends! Husband and I (mid-30s/early 40s, no kids) returned a month ago from an absolutely amazing nearly three week trip to OZ, and we wanted to report back on our trip, in case anyone is looking for advice on similar itineraries in the future! Lurking on this sub was helpful for me when planning, so I wanted to return the favor.

**Background**: husband and I had three weeks set aside in September/October for our first wedding anniversary trip but hadn't actually planned where to go. A couple months out, we sat down and literally plugged random countries into Google Flights to see what had reasonable prices, and we found an incredible deal for a one-stop RT flight from Austin to Sydney for $950USD!! It was basic economy, but I have status on American Airlines, so we got the perks of regular economy, including being able to upgrade with miles. We got an upgrade to business on our outbound flight (AUS>LAX>SYD) for 25K points + $350USD each, which was still an incredible deal for business class! We were able to sleep on the way out and hit the ground running when we arrived in SYD at 7am. 

**Cost**: I'm sure this is a big one for a lot of people--Australia is....not cheap. There are no limits to how expensive you could make things if you wanted to, but we found that even the more budget options were not super budget and were pretty comparable to USD prices. Not including the international airfare, I think we probably clocked in about $10K-12K for the three weeks, and that was a mix of some splurge experiences/hotels and some very budget ones. This also is affected by the number of domestic flights we took--all but one were paid with cash (the other was points and luckily it was the most expensive one: CNS >AYQ). Car rentals were pretty reasonable.

**People**: gosh y'all are nice. I mean, we come from what many people in the USA consider to be a pretty friendly state (except for, ya know, the Republicans and the guns), but we were truly just in awe of how nice Australians were--everyone from the Australians on the liveaboard with us, to the airbnb hosts, to the service workers at restaurants and wineries. Small talk didn't feel like small talk with y'all; it felt like genuine interest about who we were, what our plans were, why we were certain places. The only sort of ""off"" encounters we had were with a couple people (both at gas stations--one in Cairns and one in the outback) who made low-key racist comments about the indigenous people. Of course, we are white, so they were still nice *to us*, but we were definitely a bit taken aback by the comments. But apart from that, all we could think as we watched people run along the coast in the middle of the day on a weekday and enjoy wine with their Tuesday business lunches was that this is what it looks like when you live in a country that actually gives a shit about its people (or at least really tries). Such a refreshing change for an American. üòÇ 

**Animals**: probably won't be surprised to hear that literally every time we told someone we were coming to Australia, they'd mention any number of the wild and dangerous animals y'all have! But for better or for worse, we didn't really encounter any of the dangerous things--we never even saw a single snake (and we only saw one spider!). We saw a nurse shark and reef shark during our dives, but no great whites; and we saw only two saltwater crocs on our river cruise. We did see several cassowaries though!!! Which was fun. But overall, the lack of wildlife that we saw, even though we were in pretty remote places, was surprising!

**Itinerary**: Husband and I love nature, adventure, food, and wine, and we were also certified divers. Though this itinerary included a lot of domestic air travel, y'all's airports are so efficient that it did not take up too much time or make us lose entire days to travel. We packed a lot into our trip, but with the three weeks, we didn't feel like we were too busy or overwhelmed, and while we frontloaded a lot, we accounted for some relaxation on the back end. Here are the bulletpoints, with highlights:

* 2 nights/3 full days **Sydney**\--stayed at the Shangri-La (dated but nice hotel, fantastic view, great central location). Did the Bondi to Bronte beach walk, which was a lovely way to stave off jetlag and we got to see whales from the shore. Was absolutely obsessed with the ocean-side swimming pools, so we want to Coogee beach the next day to enjoy the Wylie Baths, which were amazing. Also did the Manly ferry at sunset, walked across the Harbor Bridge, and visited the Hyde Park Barracks Museum (incredible, and I'm not a museum person!). Best meals were: Aalia, dim sum at Mr. Wong, and Ho Jiak. Also went to Cantina OK and Baxter Inn--I preferred the latter.
* 4pm flight to **Cairns** for 2 night liveaboard--stayed at the Ramada Inn the night before our liveaboard (was cheap so filled the need, but would not recommend). Ate at Yaya's Hellenic Kitchen--really great meal. Liveaboard was with ProDive, and was a great experience! Was very reasonably priced for us relatively new divers on our first liveaboard. Coral was in much better shape than I was expecting, and while visibility wasn't great the first day, it get progressively better and was wonderful the last. Also a lot of Australians on our boat, so we had a great time meeting some ""locals.""
* 2 nights **Port Douglas**\--rented a car upon return to Cairns and drove up to stay at the Mai Tai Inn just outside Port Douglas (absolutely lovely hotel in the rainforest above the city with an amazing host and the cutest dogs). We did all the hits in this area: Cape Tribulation, Daintree Rainforest (and Daintree Ice Cream Company), Daintree River Crocodile Cruise, Mossman Gorge. It was torture to be not to be able to swim at as beautiful a beach as Cape Trib!! We drove into Port each night to have dinner with some friends we met on the liveaboard, and the meals (Zinc and Jungle Fowl) were good but not great.
* 1 night back in **Cairns**\--stayed at Holiday Inn off the Esplanade (way better than the Ramada but still not great). Walked all the way up and down the Esplanade and ate dinner at Bellocale, which was great.
* 12pm flight to **Yulara** for 2 nights--stayed at Sails in the Desert (incredibly expensive, but we were able to book through the Chase Sapphire Reserve travel portal and use points to decrease cash outlay; absolutely not worth the price, but pickings were slim, and it was nice) and had a rental car. We were blown away by Uluru. We did the full base walk, as well as the gorge hike in Kata Tjuta, and both were breathtakingly beautiful. Also did an astro tour with a company that was allowed to go into the park at night--the tour itself was meh but the photo we got of us with the milky way in the background was amazing. Absolute highlight was Tali Wiru though. The sunset views and canapes were absolutely amazing, the several course meal paired with all-Australian wine was delicious, the startalk was better than our tour the night before, and then campfire + hot chocolate + cognac was wonderful. Really one of the coolest things we've ever done.
* 1 night **Alice Springs**\--Drove from Uluru to King's Canyon and were able to squeeze in the gorge walk and some of the Southern Rim walk, which was great. This was a very long day of driving, but the outback--including the sheer isolation--was stunning. We stayed at the Doubletree Hotel in Alice, which was fine but nothing to write home about. We'd been warned so much about crime in Alice that, once we arrived at the hotel that had a gated parking lot, we decided to just order room service (which was not good). Alice was basically just a pit stop for us: we were actually able to get a cheaper one-way car rental and it gave us a direct flight option to Adelaide after.
* 8am flight to Adelaide for one night in **Port Noalunga**\--picked up a rental car here, and stayed at an airbnb basically the McClaren Vale area. Had wine pairing lunch at Penfolds' Magill Estate Kitchen, which was fantastic. We then drove down the D'Arenberg, which honestly sucked. Don't get us wrong: the building itself is very cool, the view is great, and if you like art, obviously having something like a Salvador Dali exhibit was great. But the service for our wine tasting was awful (so awful that when we decided we wanted to just get a refund on our tasting, they gave us our money back and still gave us a free tasting) and the wine itself was not good. Wanting to redeem our McClaren Vale experience, we went to Chalk Hill, where we got wonderful service. We then checked into our Airbnb in Port Noalunga, which had the absolute best Oz hosts and was right where the river met the ocean. We ate at Noori, which was a fantastic wine bar, and our hosts ended up there after dinner, so we partied with them and had a fabulous time.
* 2 nights **Kangaroo Island**\--drove down to the (super expensive!) Sealink ferry to KI. We stayed at Stowaway KI, at the Sleepy Hollow property--truly incredible property and amenities (with a price tag to match) right south of the breathtaking Stokes Bay. Did a private tour at the KI Wildlife Sanctuary where we got to hold koalas and feed KI kangaroos--mostly enjoyed this experience but can tell they've changed their business model from just being a sanctuary for animals after the wildfires to taking in animals that aren't native to the area (like dingos). Also did a dolphin swim with KI Marine Adventures, and our weather wasn't great, but we still got to swim with them a bit which was wonderful (and very cold). Best meal here was the KI Oyster Farm, and we also enjoyed one night in the accommodation making a charcuterie plate dinner out of all the goodies they left us. Vivonne Bay was also lovely, and we would've made it to Flinders Chase if our shitty car rental hadn't broken down on us on the way there. Luckily, an RAA tow truck driver happened to pass by us on his way home, and he towed the car for free and got us a new rental at the airport. The hospitality of people on KI was unmatched! 
* 2 nights **Barossa**\--stayed at an airbnb on the 1847 Wine property. The grounds were gorgeous but the airbnb itself was just fine. We did wine tastings at David Franz, Torbreck, Henschke (the Hill of Grace experience), and Hentley Farm. We used a consolidation service (Get Freighted) to ship wine home from the latter three, and bought a bottle at the former to stuff in our suitcases. All these wineries were fantastic, but the Hill of Grace and Hentley Farm experiences were absolute standouts. For food, we were in Barossa on a Monday and Tuesday, and reader beware: everything is pretty much closed on those days. So we ate at Vintner's Bar and Grill and Ember Pizza, which were both solid but not mind-blowing. We did eat lunch at Fino's, which was very very good. 
* 12pm flight to **Sydney** for 2 nights--stayed at the Old Clare Hotel, which was a very cool, hip place, but maybe a little too hip for its own good. Saw a show at the Sydney Opera House (Dimanche--highly recommend), visited the White Rabbit gallery, and bought art at the Big Design Market at the Carriageworks . We ate at 10 Williams Street (fantastic), Nanjing Dumpling (also fantastic), and Quay. The latter was our anniversary dinner, so we did the 6 course meal at sunset with the wine pairing, and it was truly amazing. 

**Overall impressions**: given that we booked this trip on a whim, we didn't have many expectations about Australia, and perhaps it was because of that that we were absolutely blown away by how much we loved it. We especially loved South Australia (Barossa and KI) and Sydney, and we could easily see ourselves living in either place. The nature y'all have is unparalleled in its beauty and variety, and we just loved the vibe of everywhere we went. We hope to make it back one day, and thank you for your hospitality!",1700356605.0,2023-11-19T11:16:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/17ylf4i/trip_report_3week_food_wine_and_adventure/

"Brown Snake Bite. In hospital, opinions on protocol.",17rnwo8,1349,"Kia ora, dingos.

I moved to Australia 2 months ago for work, in the outdoor education industry. Yesterday while on a bush walk I stepped over log (group of clients behind me) and came smack bang down on a big old Eastern Brown Snake. Now this guy flipped his shit, dude went ape, wrapped up around my leg and generally trying to gently tell me he wasn‚Äôt having a good time. So I legged it, ran about 100m, screamed at the group to bail the other direction and reundevous me in the clearing I ended up in. I was wearing very thick Gaiters at the time and didn‚Äôt think I had been bit but I definitely had some pretty good body contact with her. Some of the others in the group investigated and positively identified the snake.

So I whip my gaiters off to find a fresh little knick on the back of my calf and think shit that‚Äôs good I‚Äôm in the clear. Then about 4 mins later it begins swelling and my mind changed from ‚Äúallgood‚Äù to ‚Äúhmmm, fuck‚Äù so I snake wrap, lie down and call 000 to get a bit of help because I know how deadly they can be and I‚Äôm not well versed in Snake Protocol. About 30 mins later in im an ambo, double IVs in my forearm and on way to ER. After an hour I‚Äôm A-symptomatic and the concern is slowly coming down. The result was 12 hours of monitoring my bloods in the hospital and taking vitals periodically. I just had doctor tell me that my 12 hour bloods have come back with slightly elevated clotting platelets so more tests are gonna happen.

So this is where opinions come in, i‚Äôm feeling a pretty overwhelming sense of guilt about using a lot of medical resources for somthing that I can‚Äôt even certainly say was a bite. I know I had a highly venomous snake wrapped up around my leg and a fresh looking cut so I did what I think was right, but as Australians what would you do? Im wondering if n the future waiting for a while to see if the classic symptoms actually kick in, or if you were in the same spot would you call 000 and say ‚Äúbetter safe than sorry‚Äù?

I also don‚Äôt know how to identify a snake bite, if anyone knows please tell me what you think when you look at pic weather you‚Äôd be concerned.",1699566239.0,2023-11-10T07:43:59,https://i.redd.it/jla1gdqz6ezb1.jpg

Young kiwi family looking to migrate to Australia,16wxdec,18,"G‚Äôday everyone! 

Bit of a long post but forgive me. I‚Äôve been seriously considering moving over to Australia as I‚Äôm a bit over Wellington, I was born and raised here and it‚Äôs just kinda meh these days and the weather is totally depressing! 

I‚Äôm really keen to move over to Australia and I‚Äôm tossing up between a lot of the main ones that Kiwis migrate to (Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Perth) but are there any other places I should consider in my research? My father in law is HUGE on Adelaide but he‚Äôs a bit of an oldy and enjoys a lot of wine lol.

I‚Äôve got a 4 year old daughter, I‚Äôm a graduate in Commerce currently working as a Desktop Support Specialist, hoping to move into more technical IT stuff. My partner is training to be a midwife and will be done by the end of 2024. 

This move is mainly driven by me, I want our family to get out of the Wellington bubble, experience life outside of NZ and chase the opportunities abroad. 

We‚Äôre a pretty chill family, we‚Äôll get out and about a wee bit with the young one, we love food and I‚Äôm sure the mrs would appreciate soaking up some sun at a beach; otherwise we‚Äôre hermits really. I must add, I think I speak on behalf of the family that we are absolutely terrified of spiders and snakes and I hear the further North you go the worse it gets but I don‚Äôt really mind‚Ä¶. The time will come when we have to eventually face our fears!

Please, drop some suggestions below for me to look over, anything and everything, I‚Äôm really sold on just making the move to Australia anyways so let‚Äôs bring it, get this Kiwi out of NZ!

Some sort of creature in bedroom wall cavity - anyone here ever had wasps in wall?,16pwbta,19,"Has anyone had any experience of any of the different creatures we have here in Australia taking up residency in their wall, and if so how did you deal with it? 

Since Tuesday night I have noticed a weird noise from inside the wall in my bedroom and it's quite off-putting. I don't know how to describe it - not a scratching, more like a quiet tapping that at times becomes louder; I initially thought it was a pipe leaking (although - no pipes behind my bedroom wall). I read online that wasps building a nest can sound like a pipe leaking, so just wondering if anyone has ever had wasps in a wall and can describe what it sounded like? A lot of the online sources reference countries other than Australia. We also have considered obviously, that it may be a rodent (even considered a snake but leaning away from that one).

It seems to come and go through the day and night - not necessarily more active at night vs during the day - however, definitely more noticeable in the afternoon/night than first thing in the morning. My partner has removed the skirting board of the wall and created a hole in the wall, stuck a phone inside to record what's in there and there is nothing visible on there, although it isn't the most clear view and I'm assuming the noise of us working on the wall scares it off.

I see the occasional wasp in our backyard, but never more than one from time to time; I'd assume I'd see more if there was some sort of nest nearby / in my wall. 

For context, I live in country South Australia - close to the Victorian border; quite a hot and dry climate.",1695447972.0,2023-09-23T15:46:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/16pwbta/some_sort_of_creature_in_bedroom_wall_cavity/

No announcement at the gate, ground staff provide no information and tell everyone to use the app to arrange accommodation. Get booked in a hotel in Sydney CBD, by the time collect baggage, taxi to hotel it is 10pm - have to leave 7 hours later to travel back to the airport to make the 7am flight. Sydney airport on a Monday morning is a cluster and many people from the cancelled service the night before are stuck in check in lines that snake nearly to the door. Rush to make it on the plane and arrive home in Brisbane at 930am nealry 20 hours after I was supposed to. 

Virgin are denying any form of refund of ticket because I accepted the schedule change on the second cancelked flight. As if there are alternatives available at 9pm on a Sunday night out of Sydney. 

Given the current avaition white paper works there is a slim opportunity to advocate for change.

Australia Travel Advice,14i2jtz,21,"Fianc√© and I are considering coming to Australia in late October or early November for our Honeymoon. We‚Äôre looking at the East Coast. Do you have any suggestions for must sees? Also, I know this is silly, but I do have a pretty intense fear of snakes/spiders. Is it common to see them everywhere? We‚Äôre planning to stay in the cities most likely. My fianc√© is super into hiking and not concerned at all, but if there places we could go where it‚Äôs less common I‚Äôd prefer it.

Daintree wildlife advice,14hezpz,16,"Can someone recommend some of the more wildlife hotspot areas or trails in daintree? I'm staying in Port Douglas for about another week, and would like to see a good bit of wildlife in its natural setting. Ive seen the Crocs at the mowbray bridge, but I'd like to get a little more in nature. For example, in America I always know that bears, bison, and wolves hang out in the Yellowstone Lamar valley, so that's where I like to hike. I know wildlife could be anywhere, but I just wondered if there are certain areas where they're a little more common.I'm fairly well experienced with a lot of wildlife, so I know to maintain safe distances and be cautious, so no need to worry about me getting myself killed.

~~UPDATE: After spending the last few days taking everyone's advice, I'm happy to report that we've seen Crocs, kangaroos, rock wallabies, two tree kangaroos, two platypuses, an echidna, a bunch of interesting insects, a ton of beautiful birds, a cassowary, and one snake that I couldn't identify.

Who‚Äôs organising the cost of living march?,13xkjrm,142,"
Maybe it‚Äôs just me but the nations listed below have been out in numbers with great concern in terms of quality of living, whilst ours is increasing migration at large rates and hasn‚Äôt done much to increase supply or sustainable prices in the short to medium term because they‚Äôve waited till inflation to start biting to maybe think of the longevity of a generation? 

- The French
- The Brits
- The Irish 

Or are we just too passive and chill to be all taken for schmucks culturally?

Or is this just not an issue for most Australians and just a minority?

Or is it to little too late?

Does marching even do anything üòÇ 

Are we a land of serfs and feudal lords?

Why can‚Äôt we invest more in R&D for productivity growth and not that snake oil shit like carbon capturing?

What is the tipping point for the masses, could it be something to do with beer prices?

I thought the business cycle could have been smoother than this 

What‚Äôs your 2 cents on what should happen next?

I feel there will be stagnation and a painful few years ahead but what is the best way out?

Also who knows how to congregate in an orderly group?",1685633345.0,2023-06-02T01:29:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/13xkjrm/whos_organising_the_cost_of_living_march/
